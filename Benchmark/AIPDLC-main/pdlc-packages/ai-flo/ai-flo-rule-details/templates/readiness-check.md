# Readiness Check: RC-{Project-ID}

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Project ID | {PRJ-ABBREV-YYYY-NNN} |
| Target Package | {AI-DWG} |
| Checked | {ISO date} |
| Result | {ALL_READY / PARTIAL / NOT_READY} |

---

## Expected Feeds (default gate = all three)

> AI-DWG's default gate waits for **all three** peers. Proceeding with fewer is a user-approved exception with acknowledged reduced coverage.

| Feed | Source Package | Marker | Status | Completed | Path | Cluster if absent |
|------|--------------|--------|:------:|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Product Backlog (PBP) | AI-POLC | `polc-state.md` | {✅/⏳/❌/🚫} | {date or —} | {path} | Product cluster skipped |
| UX Design (UXP) | AI-UXD | `uxd-state.md` | {✅/⏳/❌/🚫} | {date or —} | {path} | UX cluster skipped |
| Architecture Package (AP) | AI-ADLC | `adlc-state.md` | {✅/⏳/❌/🚫} | {date or —} | {path} | Tech cluster skipped |

> A feed toggled OFF in the project profile is shown as 🚫 and excluded from the gate (not counted as missing).
