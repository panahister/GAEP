| Skills/expertise available | {n} | {evidence} |
| **Technical Score** | **{sum}/20** | {summary} |

### Operational Feasibility

| Criteria | Rating (1-5) | Comments |
|----------|:------------:|----------|
| Process change impact | {n} | {evidence} |
| User adoption risk | {n} | {evidence} |
| Organizational readiness | {n} | {evidence} |
| Training requirements | {n} | {evidence} |
| **Operational Score** | **{sum}/20** | {summary} |

| Resource availability timing | {n} | {evidence} |
| Dependency alignment | {n} | {evidence} |
| Regulatory/compliance deadlines | {n} | {evidence} |
| **Schedule Score** | **{sum}/20** | {summary} |

### Integration Feasibility (Brownfield Only)

> **Include IF:** Project Type is "Brownfield Extension". **Skip IF:** Pure greenfield.

| Criteria | Rating (1-5) | Comments |
|----------|:------------:|----------|
| Existing system stability for integration | {n} | {evidence — is the existing system stable enough to integrate with?} |
| API/interface availability | {n} | {evidence — does the existing system expose usable interfaces?} |
| Data migration complexity | {n} | {evidence — how complex is moving/sharing data?} |
| Backward compatibility achievability | {n} | {evidence — can we maintain compatibility with existing consumers?} |
| **Integration Score** | **{sum}/20** | {summary} |

> **Scoring note (brownfield):** When Integration Feasibility is included, the overall weighting adjusts to: Technical 25% + Operational 20% + Financial 20% + Schedule 15% + Integration 20% = 100%.
