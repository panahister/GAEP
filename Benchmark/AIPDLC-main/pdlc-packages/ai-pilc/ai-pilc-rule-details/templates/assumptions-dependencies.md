## Status Legend

### Assumptions
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ☐ Unvalidated | Not yet confirmed; proceeding on faith |
| ✅ Validated | Confirmed true |
| ❌ Invalidated | Proven false — mitigation required |
| 🔄 Under Review | Being checked |

### Dependencies
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ☐ Unconfirmed | Dependency identified but not yet secured |
| ✅ Confirmed | Provider committed; timeline agreed |
| ⚠️ At Risk | Provider indicates potential issue |
| ❌ Failed | Dependency will not be met — escalation required |

## Governance Rules

1. Every assumption is a risk in disguise — if unvalidated, it may trigger a risk
2. Dependencies should be confirmed as early as possible
3. Reviewed at every phase gate
4. Invalidated assumptions trigger immediate risk assessment
5. Failed dependencies escalate per project escalation criteria
