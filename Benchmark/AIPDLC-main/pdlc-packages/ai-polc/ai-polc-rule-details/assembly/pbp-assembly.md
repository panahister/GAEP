# Stage 13: PBP Assembly & Handoff

**Phase:** Assembly
**Purpose:** Bundle all product ownership artifacts into the complete Product Backlog Package, finalize `polc-state.md`, and signal downstream readiness for AI-DWG consumption.

---

## Purpose

This is the consolidation stage. All prior stages produced individual artifacts; this stage verifies completeness, assembles the PBP README (the package's reading guide), and sets `polc-state.md` status to `ready` — the signal that AI-DWG can now read the PBP for workspace generation.

---

## Depth Adaptation

| Depth | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Minimal** | Quick completeness check, minimal README, status flip. |
| **Standard** | Full completeness verification, cross-reference check, comprehensive README. |
| **Comprehensive** | Full verification + quality audit + stakeholder sign-off recommendation. |

---

## Steps

### Step 13.1: Completeness Verification

Check that all required artifacts exist:

| Artifact | Required | File | Status |
|----------|:---:|------|:---:|
| Product Vision & Goals | ✅ | `product-vision.md` | |
| PO Charter & Authority | ✅ | `po-charter.md` | |
| Roadmap | ✅ | `roadmap.md` | |
| Epic Definitions | ✅ | `epics/EPIC-NNN_*.md` | |
| Prioritization Register | ✅ | `prioritization-register.md` | |
| Release Plan | ✅ | `release-plan.md` | |
| Definition of Ready | ✅ | `definition-of-ready.md` | |
| Definition of Done | ✅ | `definition-of-done.md` | |
| Product Risk Register | ✅ | `product-risk-register.md` | |
| Traceability Matrix | ✅ | `traceability-matrix.md` | |
| Stakeholder Map | ✅ | `stakeholder-map.md` | |
| Release Notes Governance | ✅ | `release-notes-governance.md` | |
| State File | ✅ | `polc-state.md` | |
| Governance Spine | ✅ | `management_framework/` | |

Flag any missing artifacts. Do NOT proceed until all required files exist.

### Step 13.2: Cross-Reference Integrity Check

Verify links between artifacts:
- [ ] Every epic in `prioritization-register.md` has a matching file in `epics/`
- [ ] Every epic links to a goal in `product-vision.md`
- [ ] Every epic appears in exactly one release in `release-plan.md`
- [ ] Traceability matrix matches current epic/goal/release state
- [ ] DoR/DoD references are consistent with epic AC format
- [ ] Stakeholder map aligns with PO Charter RACI
- [ ] Risk register connects to relevant epics

### Step 13.3: Write PBP_README.md

The assembly summary and reading guide:

# Product Backlog Package — {Product Name}

## Summary
{2-3 sentences: what this product is, what the PBP contains, current state}

## Package Contents
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| product-vision.md | Product vision, goals, success metrics |
| po-charter.md | PO authority and decision boundaries |
| roadmap.md | Now/Next/Later strategic roadmap |
| epics/ | Individual epic definitions ({N} epics) |
| prioritization-register.md | Ranked backlog with {model} scores |
| release-plan.md | {N} releases defined (MVP: {summary}) |
| definition-of-ready.md | Quality bar for entering development |
| definition-of-done.md | Quality bar for shipping increments |
| product-risk-register.md | {N} product risks + assumptions |
| traceability-matrix.md | Goal→Epic→Release traceability |
| stakeholder-map.md | Stakeholder communication plan |
| release-notes-governance.md | Documentation governance |
| polc-state.md | Package state (status: ready) |

## How to Use This Package
- **AI-DWG:** Reads DoR/DoD, release cadence, AC format for workspace generation
- **AI-DLC v1:** User references prioritized epics as development intent seeds
- **AI-GCE:** Derives product governance hooks from DoR/DoD rules
- **Stakeholders:** Use traceability matrix + roadmap for status visibility

## Key Numbers
- Product Goals: {N}
- Epics: {N} (across {N} themes)
- Releases Planned: {N}
- MVP Scope: {epic count} epics
- Priority Model: {model name}
- Depth: {minimal | standard | comprehensive}

## Generated
- Package: AI-POLC v1.0.0
- Date: {ISO-date}
- Mode: {chain | standalone}
```

### Step 13.4: Finalize polc-state.md

Update the state file:
- `status: ready`
- All fields populated
- Backlog Summary current
- Upstream read timestamps recorded
- DoR/DoD versions set
- Pending Decisions: none (all resolved)

### Step 13.5: Governance Spine — Assembly Entry

Append to governance spine:
```
POLC-D-010: Product Backlog Package assembled and marked ready.
{N} epics, {N} releases, priority model: {model}.
PBP status: ready. Downstream packages can now consume.
```

## Gate

**Gate 13 — PBP Assembly Complete:**

Present to user:
```
Product Backlog Package assembled:
✅ All {N} required artifacts present
✅ Cross-references verified
✅ polc-state.md status: ready
✅ PBP_README.md written

The PBP is now ready for:
• AI-UXD to read (UX design)
• AI-DWG to read (workspace generation)
• AI-DLC v1 to reference (development execution)
• Stakeholders to review

🔀 **Chain Navigation (what's next in the AI-* Family):**
   • Sequential next: **AI-UXD** (`_UXD_`) — UX Design Life Cycle
   • Or ask AI-FLO: type `_FLO_` for routing guidance based on your project state
   • Dashboard data: type `DAT__ pdlc/polc` to update the family dashboard

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Start the next package (AI-UXD) in a NEW session.**
   Each AI-* package loads a full workflow into context;
   a fresh session keeps it fast and focused.

Approve to mark Phase 5 complete.
The product now enters Operations mode (Phase 6) for ongoing governance.
```

User must confirm. This is the **Phase 5 gate** — Assembly complete. Product transitions to Operations.

---

## Transition

→ **Phase 6: Operations** (continuous product ownership begins)

Status transitions to `operating` when user first enters Stage 14, 15, or 16.
