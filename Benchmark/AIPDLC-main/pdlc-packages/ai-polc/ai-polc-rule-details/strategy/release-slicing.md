# Stage 7: Release & Increment Slicing

**Phase:** Strategy
**Purpose:** Group prioritized epics into deliverable releases aligned to product goals, define MVP/MMP scope, and establish increment readiness criteria — answering "which stories ship together and when?"

---

## MANDATORY: Stage Sub-Role

During this stage, also adopt the **Resource Planner** sub-role:

### Behavioral Shifts
- Think in terms of delivery capacity: what can actually ship together given dependencies and team bandwidth
- Balance value (what we WANT to ship) against feasibility (what we CAN ship)
- Consider release overhead: each release has a cost (testing, coordination, communication)
- Frame releases as value increments, not arbitrary time-boxes

### Anti-Patterns
- Do NOT slice releases by arbitrary dates alone — slice by value delivered
- Do NOT pack releases so tightly that one slip cascades everything
- Do NOT create releases with no clear value proposition ("release 3 has miscellaneous leftovers")
- Do NOT ignore dependencies when grouping — if Epic A depends on Epic B, they're in the same or sequential releases

### Quality Check
Every release must pass: "Can I articulate in one sentence what value this release delivers to users?" If no → the release boundary is wrong.

---

## Depth Adaptation

| Depth | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Minimal** | 2-3 releases. MVP scope defined. Simple grouping by priority order. |
| **Standard** | 3-5 releases with value statements. MVP + MMP defined. Dependency-aware grouping. Readiness criteria per release. |
| **Comprehensive** | Full release train with increment readiness gates, rollback criteria, feature-flag strategy, multi-team coordination. |

---

## Steps

### Step 7.1: Define MVP Scope (For New Products)

If Product Maturity = New (0→1), MVP definition is critical:

**MVP Criteria:**
- What is the MINIMUM set of epics that delivers enough value to:
  - [ ] Validate the core value proposition
  - [ ] Allow real users to use the product (not just demo)
  - [ ] Generate feedback for the next iteration
  - [ ] NOT embarrass the brand (minimum quality bar)

Walk through the prioritized backlog top-down:
```
Rank 1: EPIC-003 — Provider Abstraction    → MVP? YES (core functionality)
Rank 2: EPIC-001 — Async Processing        → MVP? YES (performance goal)
Rank 3: EPIC-005 — Onboarding Redesign     → MVP? YES (users need to get in)
Rank 4: EPIC-002 — PayPal Integration      → MVP? NO (Stripe alone is viable for v1)
Rank 5: EPIC-007 — Referral Program        → MVP? NO (growth, not viability)
```

**MVP = Ranks 1-3.** Everything below is post-MVP.

For mature products, define **MMP** (Minimum Marketable Product) for the next version instead.

### Step 7.2: Group Epics Into Releases

Based on priority order, dependencies, and capacity:

| Release | Goal | Epics | Value Statement |
|---------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **R1 (MVP)** | Validate core value | EPIC-003, EPIC-001, EPIC-005 | "Users can make payments via Stripe with <2s processing and a clean onboarding flow" |
| **R2** | Expand payment options | EPIC-002, EPIC-004, EPIC-006 | "Users can pay via Stripe, PayPal, or bank transfer" |
| **R3** | Growth & optimization | EPIC-007, EPIC-008 | "Referral program drives user acquisition; analytics inform next priorities" |

**Grouping rules:**
- Respect dependency order (if B depends on A, A ships in same or earlier release)
- Each release has a coherent value statement (not "random collection")
- Release size is achievable (not 20 epics in one release for a small team)
- Critical path identified per release

### Step 7.3: Define Increment Readiness Criteria

For each release, specify what "ready to ship" means:

```
Release R1 (MVP) — Readiness Criteria:
- [ ] All 3 epics at DoD (Definition of Done met)
- [ ] Integration testing complete (all epics work together)
- [ ] Performance goal verified (<2s payment processing under load)
- [ ] No P1/P2 open bugs in release scope
- [ ] Stakeholder demo completed and accepted
- [ ] Release notes drafted
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
```

### Step 7.4: Context-Factor Adaptation

| Context Factor | Release Slicing Impact |
|---|---|
| Release Strategy = Continuous | Per-epic releases; each epic ships independently when done |
| Release Strategy = Scheduled | Batch releases aligned to calendar (sprints, PIs, quarters) |
| Release Strategy = Feature flags | Releases are deployments; features activate separately |
| Architecture = Microservices | Per-service release possible; reduces coordination cost |
| Architecture = Monolith | Whole-product release; increases coordination cost |
| Scale = Multi-team | Align releases to PI boundaries (SAFe) or coordinate cross-team |
| Compliance = Heavy | Add compliance sign-off to readiness criteria |

### Step 7.5: Define Ship/Iterate/Pivot Decision Framework

After each release ships, the PO makes a decision:

| Signal | Decision | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Metrics meet/exceed goals | **Ship + Continue** | Proceed to next release as planned |
| Metrics partially met, learning captured | **Iterate** | Adjust next release based on feedback |
| Metrics significantly missed, assumptions invalidated | **Pivot** | Re-evaluate vision; major re-prioritization |
| External change (market/competitor/regulation) | **Re-assess** | Full re-prioritization against new reality |

### Step 7.6: Persist Release Plan

Write `release-plan.md` with:
- MVP/MMP scope definition (with explicit IN/OUT)
- Release table (release → goal → epics → value statement)
- Readiness criteria per release
- Ship/Iterate/Pivot framework
- Release cadence (derived from delivery methodology context factor)
- Dependencies between releases

## Gate

**Gate 7 — Release Plan Confirmed:**

Present to user:
```
Release plan established:
• Releases defined: {N}
• MVP scope: {epic list} — "{value statement}"
• Release cadence: {continuous | per-sprint | quarterly | PI-aligned}
• Readiness criteria: defined per release

Does this delivery plan make sense for your product?
Approve to proceed to Phase 3 (Governance), or adjust.
```

User must confirm. This is also the **Phase 2 gate** — Strategy complete.

---

## Governance Spine Entry

Log in Decision Log:
```
POLC-D-006: Release plan established. {N} releases defined.
MVP: {epic list}. MVP value: "{one-line}".
Release cadence: {cadence}. Ship/iterate/pivot framework defined.
```

---

## Transition

→ **Phase 3, Stage 8: Definition of Ready / Done** (Governance begins)
