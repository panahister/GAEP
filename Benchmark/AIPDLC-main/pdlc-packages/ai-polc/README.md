## What Is AI-POLC?

AI-POLC is an injectable workflow package that guides an AI assistant and a human Product Owner through establishing and operating disciplined product ownership — from business intent to a governed, prioritized Product Backlog Package (PBP) ready for development consumption.

**Identity:** AI-POLC turns business intent into a prioritized, value-justified product backlog, and is the single source of truth for *what gets built, in what order, and why*.

---

## The AI-* PDLC Family

AI-POLC is part of **AIFLC** (AI Full Life Cycle) — the AI-* PDLC Family of injectable workflow packages.

| Layer | Package | Type | Input | Output |
|-------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Portfolio | **AI-ILC** ² | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | Raw idea | Approved Idea Brief / Feature Brief |
| Portfolio | **AI-PILC** | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | Raw requirement | Project Initiation Package (PIP) |
| Portfolio | **AI-PPM** ³ | Adaptive portfolio engine | Multiple PIPs + Approved Idea Briefs | Portfolio register + cross-project prioritization & governance |
| Edge | **AI-FLO** ³ | Router / orchestration engine | Any package output marker | Routing decision + handoff to next package/layer |
| Project | **AI-POLC** ³ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP | Product Backlog Package (PBP) |
| Project | **AI-UXD** ³ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP + PBP | UX Design Package (UXP): personas/journeys, IA, user flows, design system + tokens, accessibility baseline |
| Project | **AI-ADLC** | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP + PBP + UXP | Architecture Package (AP) |
| Project | **AI-DWG** | One-time generator | AP + PBP + UXP | Ready-to-code development workspace (DW) |
| Project | **AI-GCE** | Adaptive governance engine | DW (AI-DWG output) | Compliance enforcement layer |
| Project | **AI-TGE** | Test governance engine | DW / build artifacts | Test governance & quality layer |
| Project | **AI-DLC v1** ¹ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | DW + GCE + User Stories (from AI-POLC) | Working Software |

> ¹ **AI-DLC v1** ([awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows)) is NOT our product. Our chain produces the workspace AI-DLC v1 consumes.
> ² **AI-ILC** is an **optional pre-stage** (the funnel before the funnel). The chain still works without it for users who start at AI-PILC. `⇢` denotes the optional link.
> ³ All packages in this table are **built**. AI-PPM (portfolio engine), AI-FLO (router), AI-POLC (product ownership lifecycle), and AI-UXD (UX design lifecycle) were the last four — completed June 2026. Within the Project layer, **AI-POLC, AI-UXD, and AI-ADLC run sequentially** (POLC→UXD→ADLC) — each feeds the next, culminating at AI-DWG which receives all three outputs (AP + PBP + UXP). **AI-GCE and AI-TGE run alongside AI-DLC v1** as continuous quality engines; **AI-POLC ⇄ AI-DLC v1** exchange backlog/acceptance throughout delivery; and **AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flows back to both AI-UXD and AI-POLC**. Feedback loops (ADLC→POLC cost/risk, ADLC→UXD constraints) provide iterative refinement without changing the forward sequence.

> **AI-DFE** ([Data Fabric Engine](../ai-dfe/)) is a family-scoped **companion** — it gathers data from all packages and distributes structured JSON for dashboards and status roll-ups. It runs alongside the chain rather than as a linear step, so it is not shown as a chain row above.

## Features

### Core (Tier 1 — Always Active)

- **Product Vision & Goals** — distill business intent into measurable goals
- **PO Charter & Authority** — define decision boundaries and RACI
- **Product Discovery & Roadmap** — Now/Next/Later strategic planning
- **Epic Decomposition** — goal→epic mapping with acceptance criteria
- **Value-Based Prioritization** — WSJF, MoSCoW, or value-effort with recorded rationale
- **Release & Increment Slicing** — MVP/MMP scope + delivery groupings
- **Definition of Ready / Done** — quality bar flowing to AI-DWG and AI-GCE
- **Product Risk & Assumptions** — product-level risk register
- **Traceability** — intent→epic→release linkage
- **Stakeholder Management** — power/interest matrix + communication cadence
- **Product Documentation** — release notes and changelog governance
- **Backlog Operations** — refinement, splitting criteria, tech-debt trade-offs
- **Acceptance & Feedback** — increment acceptance against DoD, DLC feedback loop

### Story Elaboration (Tier 2 — User-Activated)

- **INVEST-compliant stories** with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
- Off by default in chain mode (AI-DLC v1 handles story creation)
- Activate for standalone use or PO-quality pre-elaboration

### Extensions (Opt-In)

- Advanced Discovery (OKRs, JTBD, opportunity scoring)

- Full Risk Register (scoring, owners, response plans, trend tracking)
- Value & Metrics Engine (KPIs, benefits realization, experiments)
- Full Product Docs (PRD, feature briefs, wiki governance)

## Output Directory Structure

AI-POLC outputs into the standard multi-project layout. Product backlog artifacts land in `backlog/` within the project folder:

```

## Activation

**Explicit key:** type `_POLC_` in any prompt to activate AI-POLC unambiguously — even when other AI-* packages share the workspace. The status key `_ACTIVE_` reports which package is currently active. A package switch never happens without your explicit key or confirmation, and any switch is announced on the first line of the response (`Active package: AI-POLC`). See [`../TRIGGER_KEYS_REFERENCE.md`](../TRIGGER_KEYS_REFERENCE.md) for the full family key table.

## Installation

See `setup/INSTALL.md` for platform-specific installation instructions.

## Tenets

1. **Value-justified** — nothing enters the backlog without answering "why does this serve the product vision?"
2. **Traceable** — every item links upward to a goal and downward to an acceptance bar
3. **Governed** — decisions are logged, priorities have rationale, changes are tracked
4. **Adaptive** — depth adapts to product complexity; context factors shape behavior
5. **Workspace-mediated** — rules reach AI-DLC v1 through steering files, not direct integration
6. **Source-driven** — derive from user input; never fabricate scope

---

## Quick Start

```
You take the role of a high-skilled professional process designer/engineer.

Using the AI-POLC package, I want to establish product ownership governance
for my product.

Context:
- Product: {your product name}
- Input: {PIP available / Architecture Package / standalone vision}
- Mode: {chain with AI-DLC v1 / standalone}

Please start the AI-POLC workflow.
```
