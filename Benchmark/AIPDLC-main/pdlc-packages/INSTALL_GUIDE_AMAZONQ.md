# AI-* Family — Complete Installation Guide for Amazon Q Developer

**Applies to:** Amazon Q Developer — full workflow support with `.amazonq/rules/` integration.

> **Why Amazon Q?** Amazon Q Developer reads workspace rules from `.amazonq/rules/` and has full file system access. All workflow packages, generators, and governance rule generation work at 100%. Only AI-GCE hook auto-execution is unavailable (Kiro-only).

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Amazon Q Developer** | VS Code extension or JetBrains plugin installed |
| **A workspace folder** | Any project directory where you want AI-assisted delivery |
| **PowerShell 5.1+** (Windows) or **Bash** (macOS/Linux) | For the automated installer |
| **The AIFLC package source** | Clone [AIPDLC](https://github.com/mbmd/AIPDLC) into a temporary `.aiflc-src/AIPDLC/` folder (Method 1 shows the command). Delete it after install — `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .aiflc-src` (Windows) or `rm -rf .aiflc-src` (macOS/Linux) — so nothing but `.aiflc/pdlc/` and `pdlc-ws/` remains at your root. |

> You do NOT need: Node.js, Python, Docker, or any runtime. Packages are pure Markdown — no compilation, no dependencies.

---

## How It Works

The installer places **one always-loaded file** plus the **package home**, both scoped to the AI-* PDLC Family (multiple AIFLC families can coexist in one workspace):

1. **Session orchestrator** — a single Markdown rule Amazon Q reads automatically at session start (placed in `.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md`). It is the ONLY always-loaded file. It detects which package you want and `Read`s that package's core on demand — keeping the context window free.
2. **Package home** — every package's core AND rule-details live together in the uniform, agent-neutral home `.aiflc/pdlc/`. Nothing here auto-loads; the orchestrator reads from it on demand.

```
your-workspace/
├── .amazonq/
│   └── rules/
│       └── pdlc/
│           └── session-orchestrator.md    ← The ONLY always-loaded file (routes to cores)
├── .aiflc/
│   └── pdlc/                              ← AI-* PDLC Family home (cores + rule-details + fabric)
│       ├── ai-pilc-rules/core-workflow.md    ← Read on demand by the orchestrator
│       ├── ai-pilc-rule-details/             ← Read on demand by the core
│       │   ├── common/  inception/  assessment/  templates/  ...
│       └── ... one {pkg}-rules/ + {pkg}-rule-details/ per installed package
├── pdlc-ws/                               ← All runtime outputs land here (never workspace root)
└── (your project files)
```

Amazon Q auto-loads only `session-orchestrator.md` from `.amazonq/rules/pdlc/`. When you activate a package (by key or intent), the orchestrator `Read`s `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-{pkg}-rules/core-*.md`, and the core reads its rule-details from `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-{pkg}-rule-details/` as each phase needs them.

> **The AIFLC model:** one orchestrator loads always-on (`.amazonq/rules/pdlc/`); every package core + its rule-details live in the uniform home `.aiflc/pdlc/` and are read on demand; and everything the packages *produce* — projects, portfolio, ideas, generated workspaces — is written under `pdlc-ws/`, never scattered at your workspace root. The `.aiflc/pdlc/` layout is identical on every platform.

## Method 1: Automated Installer (Recommended)

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Clone the source into a temporary nested folder (removed after install), then enter it
git clone https://github.com/mbmd/AIPDLC.git .aiflc-src/AIPDLC
cd .aiflc-src\AIPDLC\pdlc-packages

# Option A: Fully interactive
.\installer\install.ps1

# Option B: One-liner for Amazon Q with specific packages
.\installer\install.ps1 -TargetWorkspace "<your-project-path>" -Platform amazonq -Packages "ai-pilc,ai-adlc,ai-dwg"

# Option C: Install a preset bundle
.\installer\install.ps1 -TargetWorkspace "<your-project-path>" -Platform amazonq -Bundle full
```

### macOS / Linux (Bash)

```bash
# Clone the source into a temporary nested folder (removed after install), then enter it
git clone https://github.com/mbmd/AIPDLC.git .aiflc-src/AIPDLC
cd .aiflc-src/AIPDLC/pdlc-packages

# Option A: Fully interactive
./installer/install.sh

# Option B: One-liner for Amazon Q
./installer/install.sh --target <your-project-path> --platform amazonq --packages ai-pilc,ai-adlc,ai-dwg

# Option C: Install a preset bundle
./installer/install.sh --target <your-project-path> --platform amazonq --bundle full
```

### Preset Bundles

| Bundle | Command Flag | Packages | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Greenfield Full** | `-Bundle full` | AI-ILC + AI-PILC + AI-PPM + AI-FLO + AI-POLC + AI-UXD + AI-ADLC + AI-DWG + AI-GCE + AI-TGE + AI-DFE | New project, complete family |
| **Greenfield Minimal** | `-Bundle minimal` | AI-PILC + AI-ADLC + AI-DWG | Quick start, architecture focus |
| **Architecture Focus** | `-Bundle arch` | AI-ADLC + AI-DWG + AI-GCE | Architecture → workspace → governance |
| **Governance Only** | `-Bundle governance` | AI-GCE + AI-TGE | Existing project, add compliance |
| **Portfolio** | `-Bundle portfolio` | AI-ILC + AI-PILC + AI-PPM + AI-FLO | Multi-project management |

---

## Method 2: Manual Installation

### Single Package Example (AI-PILC)

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$Source = "<path-to-AIPDLC>"
$Target = "<your-project-path>"

# Copy the package core + rule-details into the uniform home .aiflc/pdlc/
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$Target\.aiflc\pdlc"
Copy-Item -Recurse "$Source\ai-pilc\ai-pilc-rules" "$Target\.aiflc\pdlc\"
Copy-Item -Recurse "$Source\ai-pilc\ai-pilc-rule-details" "$Target\.aiflc\pdlc\"

# Copy the session orchestrator into Amazon Q's auto-load slot (the ONLY always-loaded file)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$Target\.amazonq\rules\pdlc"
Copy-Item "$Source\session-orchestrator.md" "$Target\.amazonq\rules\pdlc\session-orchestrator.md"
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
SOURCE=<path-to-AIPDLC>
TARGET=<your-project-path>

# Copy the package core + rule-details into the uniform home .aiflc/pdlc/
mkdir -p "$TARGET/.aiflc/pdlc"
cp -R "$SOURCE/ai-pilc/ai-pilc-rules" "$TARGET/.aiflc/pdlc/"
cp -R "$SOURCE/ai-pilc/ai-pilc-rule-details" "$TARGET/.aiflc/pdlc/"

# Copy the session orchestrator into Amazon Q's auto-load slot (the ONLY always-loaded file)
mkdir -p "$TARGET/.amazonq/rules/pdlc"
cp "$SOURCE/session-orchestrator.md" "$TARGET/.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md"
```

### File Placement Convention (Amazon Q)

Cores and rule-details both live in the uniform home `.aiflc/pdlc/` (read on demand). The only always-loaded file is `.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md`.

| Package | Core (read on demand) | Details (read on demand) |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| AI-ILC | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-ilc-rules/core-workflow.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-ilc-rule-details/` |
| AI-PILC | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-pilc-rules/core-workflow.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-pilc-rule-details/` |
| AI-ADLC | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-adlc-rules/core-workflow.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-adlc-rule-details/` |
| AI-UXD | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-uxd-rules/core-workflow.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-uxd-rule-details/` |
| AI-POLC | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-polc-rules/core-workflow.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-polc-rule-details/` |
| AI-DWG | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rules/core-generator.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rule-details/` |
| AI-GCE | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-gce-rules/core-engine.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-gce-rule-details/` |
| AI-TGE | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-tge-rules/core-engine.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-tge-rule-details/` |
| AI-PPM | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-ppm-rules/core-engine.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-ppm-rule-details/` |
| AI-FLO | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-flo-rules/core-engine.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-flo-rule-details/` |
| AI-DFE | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dfe-rules/core-engine.md` | `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dfe-rule-details/` |

```

---

## Verification

1. Open your workspace in VS Code with Amazon Q Developer active
2. Start a new Amazon Q chat
3. Type: "Using AI-PILC, initiate a project"
4. **Expected:** The AI responds with the package's welcome message and begins the structured workflow

---

## Using the Packages

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start a session:** Tell the AI which package to use with the activation phrase
2. **Choose depth:** Minimal, Standard, or Comprehensive
3. **Work through stages:** The AI guides you sequentially
4. **Approve at gates:** Output presented for approval before proceeding
5. **Get deliverables:** Each stage produces one professional deliverable (written to disk)

### Depth Levels

| Level | Output Volume | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | Key essentials only | Prototypes, small projects |
| **Standard** | Professional baseline | Most projects (recommended) |
| **Comprehensive** | Enterprise-grade detail | Regulated industries, large teams |

---

## Chain Handoffs Between Packages

Packages detect each other through **state marker files** (e.g., `pilc-state.md`). Run packages sequentially and they find each other's output automatically.

---

## AI-GCE Governance on Amazon Q

AI-GCE generates all governance files correctly, but enforcement is advisory:

| Feature | Status | Workaround |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Rule generation | ✅ Works | — |
| Hook auto-execution | ❌ | Include governance rules in `.amazonq/rules/` |
| Agent triggers | ❌ | Paste agent prompts manually |
| Compliance logging | ⚠️ Manual | Ask the AI to log checks |

### Best Practice

After AI-GCE generates governance, copy the compliance summary:

```powershell
Copy-Item ".governance\COMPLIANCE_README.md" "$Target\.amazonq\rules\governance-enforce.md"
```

This ensures Amazon Q always has governance context loaded alongside the workflow packages.

---

## Session Continuity

State files persist between sessions. Say "Continue AI-PILC" to resume where you left off.

---

## Coexistence with Other Rules

- **Existing `.amazonq/rules/`**: Untouched. The family adds only one always-loaded file (`.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md`); package cores live under `.aiflc/pdlc/`.
- **Other project files**: Never modified.

---

## Uninstalling

```powershell
# Via installer
.\installer\install.ps1 -TargetWorkspace "<your-project-path>" -Uninstall

# Manual
Remove-Item "<your-project-path>\.amazonq\rules\pdlc\session-orchestrator.md" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-ChildItem "<your-project-path>\.aiflc\pdlc\ai-*-rules" -Directory | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Get-ChildItem "<your-project-path>\.aiflc\pdlc\ai-*-rule-details" -Directory | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item "<your-project-path>\pdlc-ws\.ai-family-manifest.json" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Orchestrator not loading | Wrong location | Verify `.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md` exists |
| Package core not found | Path mismatch | Verify `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-{pkg}-rules/core-*.md` exists |
| "Can't find rule-details" | Path mismatch | Core resolves `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-{pkg}-rule-details/` first |
| No welcome message | Wrong activation phrase | Use "Using AI-PILC, ..." format |
| State file not created | First interaction only | State is created after first stage completes |

---

## Platform Capabilities Summary

| Feature | Amazon Q |
|---------|:--------:|
| Core workflow execution | ✅ |
| On-demand file loading | ✅ |
| Deliverable file output | ✅ |
| State persistence | ✅ |
| Chain marker detection | ✅ |
