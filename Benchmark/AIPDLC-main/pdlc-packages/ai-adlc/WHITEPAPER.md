## The Problem

Architecture is where enterprise projects most often fail — not from bad code, but from bad decisions made too early or good decisions made too late.

The typical pattern: a team picks technologies based on familiarity, not fitness. Security is bolted on after development starts. Data models emerge from code rather than design. Integration patterns are discovered during testing. Six months in, someone asks "why did we choose this?" and nobody can answer — because the decision was never recorded.

Even teams that invest in architecture documentation face a different failure: the architecture document becomes a historical artifact. It was accurate on day one. By sprint four, the codebase has drifted. The document sits in Confluence, increasingly irrelevant, increasingly ignored.

---

## The Solution

AI-ADLC is an injectable workflow that trains an AI assistant to act as a pragmatic CTO/Chief Architect. It walks you through 5 phases and 13 stages of structured architecture design — producing a comprehensive Architecture Package with every decision recorded, every trade-off documented, and every constraint acknowledged.

**You make architecture decisions. The AI structures, documents, and cross-validates them.**

The AI doesn't design in isolation. It presents options with trade-offs, asks constraint-aware questions, and ensures that no decision contradicts a previous one. Every major choice produces a formal Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

## How It Works

```
Requirements/PIP → FOUNDATION → DECOMPOSITION → DECISIONS → DESIGN → ASSEMBLY → Architecture Package
```

**5 Phases, 13 Stages:**

| Phase | What Happens | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Foundation | Ingest requirements, establish vision, set boundaries | System Vision, Architecture Workbook |
| Decomposition | C4 L1-L2: define system context and containers | System Context Diagram, Container Architecture |
| Decisions | Technology, multi-tenancy, security identity | ADRs (3-8 formal decision records) |
| Design | Data, API, integration, component architecture (C4 L3) | Data Architecture, API Architecture, Component Diagrams |
| Assembly | Consolidate, cross-validate, produce final package | Architecture Package (11+ documents) |

Progressive decomposition: never detail internals before boundaries are defined. C4 Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3, in order.

---

## Who It's For

| Role | Pain Point Solved |
|------|-------------------|
| **CTO / VP Engineering** | Consistent architecture quality across projects — every decision recorded with rationale |
| **Solution Architect** | Structured design process that doesn't skip steps — prevents "architecture by accident" |
| **Tech Lead** | Clear ADRs that answer "why did we choose this?" for every developer who joins later |
| **Development Team** | An Architecture Package that's actually useful — not a 200-page PDF nobody reads |
| **Enterprise Architect** | Cross-project architectural consistency via standardized decision recording |

## Key Differentiators

### 1. ADR-Driven

Every significant decision produces a formal Architecture Decision Record: context, options considered, decision, trade-offs, consequences. This isn't just documentation — it's institutional memory that survives team turnover.

### 2. Constraint-First

The AI never recommends solutions outside stated boundaries. Budget, team skills, timeline, existing infrastructure — constraints are captured first and respected throughout. No "ideal world" architecture that the team can't build.

### 3. Extension System (v1.1)

Six opt-in advanced patterns activate only when the architecture justifies them:
- **DDD Tactical** — Aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events
- **Microservices** — Service boundaries, communication patterns, data ownership
- **BFF Pattern** — Backend-for-frontend layer design
- **Event Sourcing** — Event store, projections, temporal queries
- **Resilience** — Circuit breakers, bulkheads, retry policies, graceful degradation
- **Feature Flags** — Progressive delivery, canary releases, toggle management

Extensions are blocking when active — not optional suggestions.

### 4. Adaptive Depth

Three depth levels adapt to project complexity:
- **Minimal** — Internal tools, small teams (lighter deliverables)
- **Standard** — Most enterprise projects (full ADR coverage)
- **Comprehensive** — Large distributed systems, regulated industries (extended analysis)

### 5. Brownfield-Aware

Existing system integration is a first-class concern. AI-ADLC handles "extend this existing architecture" as naturally as greenfield design — loading existing decisions, identifying deltas, focusing on what's new.

### 6. Injectable

Not a modeling tool. Not a SaaS platform. Markdown files that inject into any AI-capable IDE. You keep your tools; AI-ADLC adds the architecture methodology.

## What You Get

A complete **Architecture Package (AP)** containing:

- System Vision & Scope
- Architecture Workbook (living reference)
- System Context Diagram (C4 L1)
- Container Architecture (C4 L2)
- Component Architecture (C4 L3, per container)
- Data Architecture (schema strategy, storage decisions)
- API Architecture (contracts, versioning, standards)
- Integration Architecture (event flows, external systems)
- Infrastructure Architecture (deployment, scaling, networking)
- 3-8 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Architecture State File (for downstream consumption)

All in structured markdown. All traceable. All ready for AI-DWG to transform into a development workspace.

## Part of AIFLC — the AI-* PDLC Family

AI-ADLC is the second node in the AI-* PDLC Family chain. It can consume a PIP from AI-PILC, and its output (AP) feeds AI-DWG for workspace generation. But it works perfectly standalone — if you have requirements from any source, AI-ADLC produces a complete Architecture Package independently.

## Getting Started

See [setup/INSTALL.md](./setup/INSTALL.md) for platform-specific installation instructions.

**Activation:** After installation, start a chat and say:
```
Using AI-ADLC, design the architecture for this system: [provide source]
```
