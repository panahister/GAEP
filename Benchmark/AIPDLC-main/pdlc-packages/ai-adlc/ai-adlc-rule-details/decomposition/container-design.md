# Container Design (C4 Level 2)

## Stage: 5 of 13
## Phase: 🟠 DECOMPOSITION
## Execution: ALWAYS

---

## Purpose

Decompose the system (the single box from C4 L1) into its major **containers** — the independently deployable/runnable units that make up the system. Each container is a separately running process or deployment unit: an application, a database, a cache, a message queue, a background worker, etc.

**CTO Mindset:** "What are the big runtime pieces? What deploys independently? What has its own process boundary?"

---

## MANDATORY: Stage Sub-Role — Systems Engineer

During THIS stage, ALSO adopt the mindset of a **Systems Engineer**. This does NOT replace your primary role (CTO / Chief Architect) — it ADDS a thinking dimension.

### Behavioral Shifts
- Define each container as an independently deployable unit with a clear responsibility boundary and scaling story
- Map inter-container communication explicitly: synchronous (creates coupling) vs. asynchronous (decouples)
- Identify fault domains — "if this container fails, what else fails?" — and isolate where possible
- Challenge co-location of responsibilities — "must these be in the same container, or are they separate for a reason?"

### Anti-Patterns for This Stage
- Do NOT group by technical layer (API container, DB container) — group by business capability
- Do NOT assume synchronous REST between all containers — justify sync vs. async for each connection

### Quality Check
A good output at this stage sounds like:
- "5 containers identified: each with responsibility, technology, scaling strategy, and failure isolation; 3 sync + 2 async inter-container links, each justified..."

---

## Depth Adaptation

| Depth | Container Design Behavior |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **Minimal** | Identify containers by type (app, DB, cache). Brief responsibility per container. Single diagram. Minimal relationship detail. |
| **Standard** | Full C4 L2 diagram with technology labels. Container table with responsibility, technology, and scaling. Relationship table with protocol and data flow direction. |
| **Comprehensive** | Multiple diagram views (runtime, deployment, data flow). Container capacity analysis. Detailed inter-container communication (sync/async, payload, frequency). Container failure modes and fallback behavior. |

---

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Load Context

1. System Context document (Stage 4) — actors, external systems, relationships
2. Architecture Vision (Stage 3) — principles (especially: monolith vs. microservices, deployment constraints)
3. Requirements Summary (Stage 2) — functional domains, scale targets, NFRs
4. State file — constraints, principles

---

### Step 2: Determine Decomposition Strategy

Before identifying containers, decide the structural approach:

```markdown
### Q-DEC-02: Decomposition Strategy

**Context:** The system needs to be split into runtime units. The approach fundamentally affects complexity, team coordination, and deployment.

**Options:**
- (a) **Modular Monolith** — Single deployable application with strong internal module boundaries. Shared database. Simplest operations.
- (b) **Service-Oriented** — 2-5 coarse-grained services with clear bounded contexts. Separate deployments, possibly shared database.
- (c) **Microservices** — Many small, independently deployable services. Each owns its data. Complex operations but maximum independence.
- (d) **Hybrid** — Monolith core with extracted services for specific concerns (e.g., async workers, real-time, integrations).

**Decision Drivers:**
- Team size: {n} FTE (from Stage 2)
- Principle: {reference relevant principle — e.g., "P5: Modular Monolith First"}
- Scale requirements: {summary}
- Deployment constraint: {on-prem/cloud/hybrid}

**Recommended:** {option}
**Rationale:** {Reference team size, operational complexity tolerance, principles. A team of <20 rarely benefits from microservices. On-prem deployment favors fewer moving parts.}

→ _This decision generates ADR-{nnn}_

**Your Decision:** _[awaiting input]_
```

**If principles already dictate this (e.g., "P5: Modular Monolith First"):** Skip the question and confirm: "Per Principle P5, we're using a modular monolith approach. Confirmed?"

---

### Step 3: Identify Containers

Based on the decomposition strategy, identify all runtime containers:

#### Container Categories

| Category | What It Is | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Application** | Code that runs business logic | API server, web app, worker process |
| **Web/UI** | Frontend application served to users | SPA, static site, server-rendered app |
| **Data Store** | Persistent storage | RDBMS, document DB, graph DB |
| **Cache** | Fast temporary storage | Redis, Memcached, Valkey |
| **Search** | Full-text search index | Elasticsearch, Meilisearch, OpenSearch |
| **Queue/Broker** | Message passing / job scheduling | RabbitMQ, Redis queues, Kafka |
| **File Storage** | Binary/document storage | MinIO, local filesystem, NFS |
| **Proxy/Gateway** | Traffic routing and TLS | Nginx, HAProxy, API gateway |
| **Background Worker** | Async processing | Email sender, report generator, AI caller |

#### Container Identification Process

For each functional domain (from Stage 2), ask:
1. Does this need its own runtime process? Or can it be a module within an existing container?
2. Does this have different scaling characteristics? (If yes → separate container)
3. Does this have different technology requirements? (If yes → separate container)
4. Does this have different deployment cadence? (If yes → consider separation)

**Produce the container list:**

```markdown
## Containers

| # | Container | Type | Responsibility | Technology (TBD) | Scaling Model |
|---|-----------|------|---------------|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| 1 | {name} | {Application/DataStore/Cache/etc.} | {What it does — 1 sentence} | _[Stage 6]_ | {Horizontal/Vertical/N/A} |
```

**Rules:**
- Name by RESPONSIBILITY, not technology ("API Server" not "NestJS App")
- Technology column left as TBD (filled in Stage 6 — Technology Stack)
- Each container has ONE clear primary responsibility
- If a container does too many things → consider splitting
- Include infrastructure containers (database, cache, queue) — they're real deployment units

---

### Step 4: Define Container Responsibilities

For each container, clearly document:

```markdown
### {Container Name}

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Type** | {Application / Data Store / Cache / Queue / UI / Worker / Proxy} |
| **Primary Responsibility** | {One sentence — what it does and why it exists separately} |
| **Secondary Responsibilities** | {Additional things it handles, if any} |
| **Data Owned** | {What data this container is authoritative for} |
| **Scaling** | {How it scales — horizontal (add instances) / vertical (add resources) / fixed} |
| **Statefulness** | {Stateless (can restart/scale freely) / Stateful (needs persistence)} |
| **Availability Requirement** | {Must be HA / Can tolerate brief downtime / Background (eventually consistent)} |
```

---

### Step 5: Define Inter-Container Relationships

Map how containers communicate with each other:

```markdown
## Container Relationships

| From | To | Communication | Pattern | Data/Purpose |
|------|----|:-------------:|---------|-------------|
| {Container A} | {Container B} | {Sync REST / Async Queue / Direct DB / WebSocket / Event} | {Request-Response / Pub-Sub / Fire-and-Forget / Streaming} | {What flows between them} |
```

**Communication patterns to consider:**

| Pattern | When to Use | Trade-off |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Synchronous (REST/gRPC)** | Caller needs immediate response | Coupling; cascading failure risk |
| **Asynchronous (Queue)** | Work can be deferred; fire-and-forget | Complexity; eventual consistency |
| **Event-driven (Pub/Sub)** | Multiple consumers; loose coupling | Event schema management; ordering |
| **Shared Database** | Monolith; same bounded context | Tight coupling but simple |
| **Streaming (WebSocket/SSE)** | Real-time updates to clients | Connection management; scaling |

---

### Step 6: Map Actors and Externals to Containers

Show which container each actor/external system communicates with:

```markdown
## External Communication Mapping

| External Entity | Communicates With (Container) | Protocol | Direction |
|----------------|:-----------------------------:|----------|:---------:|
| {Actor 1 — from L1} | {Container name} | {HTTPS, etc.} | Inbound |
| {External System 1 — from L1} | {Container name} | {Protocol} | {In/Out/Both} |
```

**Validation:** Every actor and external system from Stage 4 MUST map to at least one container. If something from L1 has no container to talk to, either a container is missing or the L1 was wrong.

---

### Step 7: Produce C4 Level 2 Diagram

Following `common/diagram-standards.md`:

```mermaid
C4Container
    title {System Name} — Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

    Person(actor1, "Actor 1", "Description")

    System_Boundary(sys, "System Name") {
        Container(app, "API Server", "Technology TBD", "Business logic and REST API")
        Container(web, "Web Application", "Technology TBD", "User interface SPA")
        ContainerDb(db, "Database", "Technology TBD", "Persistent data")
        Container(cache, "Cache", "Technology TBD", "Session and config cache")
        Container(worker, "Background Worker", "Technology TBD", "Async processing")
        Container(queue, "Message Queue", "Technology TBD", "Job scheduling")
    }

    System_Ext(ext1, "External System", "Description")

    Rel(actor1, web, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(web, app, "Calls", "REST/JSON")
    Rel(app, db, "Reads/Writes", "SQL")
    Rel(app, cache, "Reads/Writes", "TCP")
    Rel(app, queue, "Enqueues jobs", "Protocol")
    Rel(worker, queue, "Consumes jobs", "Protocol")
    Rel(app, ext1, "Integrates", "Protocol")
```

**Diagram rules:**
- [ ] System boundary box contains ALL containers
- [ ] Actors and external systems from L1 shown OUTSIDE the boundary
- [ ] Every container has: name, type label, responsibility description
- [ ] Technology labels show "TBD" if Stage 6 hasn't been done yet
- [ ] Relationship arrows labeled with protocol
- [ ] Max 15 elements in one diagram; split if larger

---

### Step 8: Identify Key Architecture Decisions

During container design, decisions arise that need ADRs. Common ones:

| Decision | ADR Trigger |
|----------|:----------:|
| Monolith vs. services | ✅ (if not already decided in Step 2) |
| Number of UI applications (1 vs. many) | ✅ if debated |
| Shared database vs. database-per-service | ✅ |
| Sync vs. async communication patterns | ✅ if significant trade-off |
| Queue/broker selection approach | Usually deferred to Stage 6 |

Produce ADRs for any decisions made. Log in state file ADR register.

---

### Step 9: Update State File

Store the container list in state (used by all subsequent stages):

```markdown
## Containers (from Stage 5)

| Container | Type | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| {name} | {type} | {responsibility} |
```

---

### Step 10: Present for Review

```markdown
## Review: Container Design (C4 Level 2) — {system_name}

I've decomposed the system into its major containers.

**Decomposition strategy:** {Monolith / Service-Oriented / Microservices / Hybrid}

**Containers identified ({n}):**
| # | Container | Type | Responsibility |
|---|-----------|------|---------------|
{container table}

**Communication patterns:**
- Sync (REST): {n} relationships
- Async (Queue): {n} relationships
- Real-time (WebSocket): {n} relationships

**Key design observations:**
- {Observation 1 — e.g., "Single application container with 3 separate UIs"}
- {Observation 2 — e.g., "Background worker decoupled for AI and email processing"}
- {Observation 3 — e.g., "Cache layer critical for multi-tenant config performance"}

**ADRs produced this stage:** {n}

**Full document:** Saved to `{file_path}`

---

**Your response:**
- (a) **Approve** — Container structure is right; proceed to Technology Stack
- (b) **Split a container** — {X} should be two separate containers
- (c) **Merge containers** — {X} and {Y} should be one container
- (d) **Add a container** — Missing a runtime unit
- (e) **Challenge communication** — Sync/async patterns need revision
```

---

### Step 11: Log and Transition

1. Update state: Stage 5 = ✅ Done; Current Phase = DECISIONS; Current Stage = 6
2. Update Architecture Workbook: session log
3. Log ADRs produced

Display:

```

## Container Design Quality Checks

| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| Single Responsibility | Each container has one clear purpose |
| Complete mapping | Every L1 actor/external maps to at least one container |
| No orphans | Every container participates in at least one relationship |
| Scaling clarity | Each container's scaling model is stated |
| Communication labeled | Every relationship has protocol and pattern |
| Principle compliance | Decomposition aligns with architecture principles |
| Constraint compliance | No container requires infrastructure that violates constraints |
| Reasonable count | Not too few (<3 suggests under-decomposition) or too many (>20 suggests premature microservices) |
