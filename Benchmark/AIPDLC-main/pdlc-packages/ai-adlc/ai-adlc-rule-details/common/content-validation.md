# Content Validation

## Purpose

Before creating or saving ANY architecture document, the AI MUST validate its content against the rules in this document. Architecture documents have additional quality requirements beyond standard document formatting — they must be technically consistent, constraint-compliant, and diagrammatically correct.

---

## Validation Checklist (Apply to Every Architecture Document)

### 1. Document Metadata

Every architecture document MUST include:

- [ ] Document title (H1 heading)
- [ ] Document status (Draft / Review / Approved)
- [ ] Version number
- [ ] Date
- [ ] Author role (e.g., "CTO", "Architecture Lead")
- [ ] System/project name

**Format:**
```markdown
# {Document Title}

**Document Status:** {Draft / Review / Approved}
**Version:** {n.n}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Author:** {Role}
```

---

### 2. Architectural Consistency Checks

Before saving any document, verify it is consistent with:

| Check Against | What to Verify |
|---------------|---------------|
| Architecture Principles (Stage 3) | No recommendation contradicts a defined principle |
| Constraints (Stage 3) | No technology or pattern violates a constraint |
| System Context (Stage 4) | External systems referenced exist in C4 L1 |
| Container list (Stage 5) | Containers referenced match those defined in C4 L2 |
| Technology Stack (Stage 6) | Technologies mentioned match the selected stack |
| ADRs | Decisions in documents match accepted ADR decisions |
| Previous documents | No contradictions with earlier approved artifacts |

**If inconsistency found:**
1. Flag to user: "This recommendation conflicts with {Principle Pn / Constraint Cn / ADR-nnn}. Should I adjust?"
2. Do NOT save until resolved
3. If user overrides a principle → log in Architecture Workbook as a principle revision candidate

---

### 3. Constraint Compliance Gate

CRITICAL: Every architectural recommendation MUST pass a constraint check:

```
For each recommendation:
  For each constraint in state file:
    Does this recommendation violate this constraint?
    If YES → DO NOT RECOMMEND. Find an alternative that complies.
    If MAYBE → Flag to user with explanation.
    If NO → Proceed.
```

**Common constraint violations to catch:**
- Recommending a cloud-managed service when "on-premises only" is a constraint
- Recommending a commercial/proprietary tool when "open-source only" is a constraint
- Recommending a pattern that can't meet stated performance targets
- Recommending a technology the team doesn't have skills for (without acknowledging the gap)

---

### 4. Diagram Validation

Architecture documents heavily use diagrams. All diagrams must be validated.

#### C4 Diagrams (Mermaid)

```markdown
```mermaid
C4Context
    title {System Name} — System Context
    Person(user, "User", "Description")
    System(sys, "System", "Description")
    System_Ext(ext, "External", "Description")
    Rel(user, sys, "Uses", "HTTPS")
```​
```

**C4 validation rules:**
- [ ] Every Person/System has a description
- [ ] Every Relationship has a label and protocol/technology
- [ ] System names match those defined in earlier C4 levels
- [ ] No orphan nodes (everything has at least one relationship)
- [ ] Title matches the document context
- [ ] Boundary boxes used for grouping where appropriate

#### ASCII Diagrams (Alternative)

```
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│   Component A    │────────►│   Component B    │
│   (NestJS API)   │  REST   │   (PostgreSQL)   │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
```

**ASCII diagram rules:**
- [ ] Consistent character set (box-drawing OR simple +/- characters — don't mix)
- [ ] Technology labels on boxes
- [ ] Protocol/pattern labels on arrows
- [ ] Under 100 characters wide
- [ ] Text description provided below for accessibility

#### Diagram Consistency Across Documents

- [ ] C4 L2 containers must be a subset of what's inside C4 L1 system boundary
- [ ] C4 L3 components must exist within a C4 L2 container
- [ ] Technology labels on diagrams match ADR decisions
- [ ] External system names consistent across all diagrams

---

### 5. ADR Validation

Every ADR file must:

- [ ] Follow the template structure (Context, Drivers, Options, Decision, Rationale, Consequences)
- [ ] Have a unique sequential number (no gaps, no duplicates)
- [ ] Have a status (Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded)
- [ ] List at least 2 options that were genuinely considered
- [ ] Include both positive AND negative consequences
- [ ] Reference the decision drivers that justified the choice
- [ ] Be cross-referenced in the parent architecture document
- [ ] Be registered in the state file ADR register

---

### 6. Technical Accuracy

Architecture documents must be technically sound:

| Check | What to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| **Technology names** | Correct spelling, correct version numbers, official names (not nicknames) |
| **Protocol references** | Correct protocol names (REST, gRPC, AMQP, not "API calls") |
| **Port numbers** | Standard ports cited correctly (5432 for PostgreSQL, 6379 for Redis, etc.) |
| **License claims** | If claiming "MIT licensed" — verify it's actually MIT (not MIT-0, not Apache, not AGPL) |
| **Performance claims** | If citing benchmarks, qualify with "under typical conditions" or reference source |
| **Ecosystem claims** | If claiming "largest ecosystem" or "most popular" — be accurate or hedge |
| **Version currency** | Recommend current/LTS versions, not outdated ones |

---

### 7. Completeness Per Document Type

#### Architecture Vision Document
- [ ] Vision statement present (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Principles listed with ID, name, statement, and rationale
- [ ] Constraints table with source and impact
- [ ] Quality attributes with priority levels
- [ ] Stakeholder concerns mapping

#### C4 Diagrams (L1, L2, L3)
- [ ] Diagram present (Mermaid or ASCII)
- [ ] Every element described in a table below the diagram
- [ ] Relationships documented with technology/protocol
- [ ] Narrative explanation accompanies the diagram

#### Technology Stack Document
- [ ] Every container has technology selected
- [ ] Each selection has rationale (even if brief)
- [ ] Key selections reference their ADR
- [ ] Alternatives considered (at least mentioned)
- [ ] Stack compatibility verified (no conflicting choices)

#### Security Architecture
- [ ] Authentication methods defined
- [ ] Authorization model defined
- [ ] Encryption (at rest + in transit) specified
- [ ] Audit logging approach defined
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 considerations addressed (at minimum acknowledged)

---

### 8. Cross-Reference Integrity

When an architecture document references another:

- [ ] Referenced document exists (or is planned in a future stage)
- [ ] ADR numbers cited exist in the ADR folder
- [ ] Principle IDs (P1, P2, etc.) match those in the Vision document
- [ ] Constraint IDs (if used) match state file
- [ ] Container names match C4 L2 exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Component names match C4 L3 exactly

**Format for references:**
- Same folder: `See 04_Technology_Stack.md`
- ADR reference: `See ADR/ADR-001_Technology_Stack.md`
- Principle reference: `(Principle P3: {name})`
- Future document: `_[To be detailed in Stage {n}]_`

---

### 9. File Naming Conventions

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Numbered documents: 2-digit prefix | `01_Architecture_Vision.md` |
| ADRs: ADR-{NNN}_{Title} | `ADR-001_Technology_Stack.md` |
| Underscores for spaces | `Security_Identity_Architecture.md` |
| No spaces in file names | ✅ `Data_Architecture.md` ❌ `Data Architecture.md` |
| State file lowercase hyphenated | `adlc-state.md` |
| Workbook title case | `Architecture_Workbook.md` |
| Drafts marked | `03_Container_Diagram_DRAFT.md` |

---

### 10. Placeholder Hygiene

Architecture documents should have fewer placeholders than PMO documents (because the architect IS making the decisions), but some are acceptable:

| Acceptable Placeholders | Context |
|------------------------|---------|
| `_[To be detailed in Stage {n}]_` | Forward reference to a future stage |
| `_[Pending team input]_` | Requires developer team consultation |
| `_[TBD — depends on ADR-{nnn}]_` | Blocked by an upstream decision |
| `_[Performance target: validate in load test]_` | Architecture assumption to be verified |

**Unacceptable in architecture documents:**
- `_[TBD]_` without explanation (must say WHY it's TBD)
- Placeholder for a technology choice (the CTO must decide, not defer)
- Placeholder for a pattern (the architect must choose)

---

## Validation Failure Handling

If validation fails:

1. **Constraint violation:** DO NOT save. Alert user. Propose compliant alternative.
2. **Diagram syntax error:** Fix automatically if unambiguous. Re-validate.
3. **Cross-reference mismatch:** Alert user. Ask which document is authoritative.
4. **ADR inconsistency:** Flag the conflict. Ask if earlier ADR should be superseded.
5. **Technical inaccuracy:** Correct silently if factual (e.g., wrong port number). Flag if judgment-based.

---

## Architecture Document vs. PMO Document Rules

| Rule | Architecture Docs | PMO Docs (AI-PILC) |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Placeholders allowed? | Minimal — architect decides | More acceptable — decisions may be pending |
| Diagrams required? | Yes — at least one per stage | Optional |
| ADR cross-references? | Required for major decisions | N/A |
| Technical specificity? | High — name specific technologies, versions, patterns | Low — high-level statements |
| Constraint checking? | Mandatory on every recommendation | Applies to scope only |
