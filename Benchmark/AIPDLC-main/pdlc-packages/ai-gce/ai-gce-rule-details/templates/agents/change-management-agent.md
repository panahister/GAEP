# Change Management Agent

## Purpose

Validates change management governance compliance before any release or deployment reaches production. Checks that a change management plan exists, UAT is traceable to requirements, stakeholder sign-off is documented, rollback criteria are defined, and training completion is verified. Prevents ungoverned changes from reaching production.

## When to Invoke

Call this agent **before any release or deployment** — after development is complete but before pushing to production.

- **Trigger:** Type `CMG__` in the chat prompt
- **Cadence:** Every release cycle (could be weekly, bi-weekly, or per-feature)
- **Process point:** After final testing, before production deployment

**Concrete examples:**
- "Release v1.3.0 is ready to deploy" → call `CMG__` first
- "Hotfix going to prod" → call `CMG__` (even hotfixes need governance)
- "Feature flag flip for Feature X" → call `CMG__` if it exposes new functionality to users
- "Database migration to production" → call `CMG__` (infrastructure changes count)

## Consequences of Skipping

**Immediate impact:**
- Changes reach production without documented plan
- No rollback criteria defined → if things break, ad-hoc recovery
- Stakeholders surprised by changes they didn't approve
- UAT not traceable → "did we actually test this?"

**Accumulated debt (3+ missed releases):**
- Cannot demonstrate controlled change process (regulatory finding)
- Incident response hampered — no rollback playbook exists
- Stakeholder trust erodes — they learn about changes after the fact
- SOX/ISO compliance gap: "no evidence of change authorization"
- Audit score critically low in "change management" category

## Recovery

If you missed `CMG__` before a deployment:

1. **If not yet in production:** STOP. Run `CMG__` now. Fix gaps. Then deploy.
2. **If already in production:**
   - Run `CMG__` retroactively — document the change post-facto
   - Log as a **change management exception** in compliance-log:
     ```json
     {"type": "EXCEPTION", "ruleId": "CM-01", "justification": "Deployed without CMG gate — retroactive documentation"}
     ```
   - Write the change plan retroactively (document what changed, why, rollback option)
   - Conduct a brief post-mortem: why was the gate skipped? (time pressure? forgotten? process unclear?)
   - Update the release checklist to include `CMG__` as a mandatory step
3. For recurring skips: escalate to team lead — may need to enforce via CI pipeline gate

## Checks Performed

1. **Change plan exists:** Is there a documented change plan for this release? (what's changing, why, risk level, rollback)
2. **UAT traceability:** Can every feature in the release be traced back to:
   - A user story or requirement (what was requested)
   - A test case (how it was verified)
   - A test execution result (proof it passed)
3. **Stakeholder sign-off:** Is there documented approval from the required stakeholders? (per the project's change authority matrix)
4. **Rollback criteria:** Are rollback conditions defined? (what signals trigger a rollback, who decides, what's the procedure)
5. **Rollback procedure:** Is the actual rollback method documented and tested? (not just "we'll figure it out")
6. **Training completion:** If the change affects end-users, is training/documentation updated?
7. **Communication plan:** Are affected parties notified? (operations team, support team, end-users if applicable)
8. **Deployment window:** Is there an agreed deployment window? (not during peak usage, not on a Friday afternoon)

## Output

- **If all checks pass:** Confirmation — "Change management gate: ✅ Release {version} cleared for deployment."
- **If violations found:**
  - Per-check report with severity (🔴 Critical = deployment should not proceed)
  - Compliance log entry appended to `compliance-log/events/{today-date}.jsonl`
  - Event type: `check`, hook: `change-management-agent`, result: `pass|fail|warn`
  - For missing rollback criteria: result is `fail` (blocking recommendation)

**Output location:** `.governance/compliance-log/events/`
