# DASHBOARDS.md Hub Index — Template

This template defines the `management_framework/dashboards/DASHBOARDS.md` marker file.
Any package that detects "no hub exists" creates this file as part of Step 3 in the
Dashboard Framework Contract §4 contribution behavior.

AI-GCE generates this template because it is typically the first package to create the
`dashboards/` folder (the compliance dashboard is the first to exist in the family).
However, ANY package that finds no hub may create it — the contract is package-agnostic.

**Dashboard Framework Contract:** v1.0.0

# Dashboards

Consolidated dashboard hub for **{project_name}** (Project ID: `{project_id}`).
Each AI-* package contributes its own dashboard here, identified by `generatedBy` front-matter.

## Conventions

- One file per package, named by concern (`{concern}-dashboard.md`).
- Producer identified by `generatedBy` front-matter (not by filename or folder).
- Dashboards are regenerated (not hand-maintained) — `ownership: generated`.
- Filter by `generatedBy` to identify a package's contribution.
- Detection: this file's presence means "a dashboard hub exists here."
- RAG legend: 🟢 On Track / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Off Track.
- Staleness: if a dashboard's `generatedOn` is older than its source's last-modified date, it is stale.

## Operating Mode

- **Project mode** (default): Per-project dashboards sit flat in this folder.
- **Portfolio mode** (>1 project): Portfolio dashboards (PPM/FLO/ILC) sit flat here;
  per-project dashboards are partitioned under `{Project ID}/` subfolders.

See `DASHBOARD_FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md` §2 for full mode definitions.

## Usage Notes for AI-GCE Core Generator

When AI-GCE generates the compliance dashboard, it also checks for the hub:

```
Step 8 (Dashboard generation):
1. Check: does management_framework/dashboards/DASHBOARDS.md exist?
2. IF NO → generate dashboards/ folder + DASHBOARDS.md from this template + compliance-dashboard.md
3. IF YES → refresh compliance-dashboard.md only + update AI-GCE row in hub
```

This template is the authoritative source for the hub marker structure.
Other packages reference it but do NOT embed their own copy — they read the existing hub.

---

*Template Version: 1.0.0 | Package: AI-GCE (hub creator, any package may also create)*
