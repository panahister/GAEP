## The Problem

Standards don't enforce themselves.

The typical pattern: a team agrees on architecture principles in week one. By week six, half the codebase violates them. Not maliciously — just entropy. A developer joins who wasn't in the original meetings. A deadline hits and someone takes a shortcut. The wiki with conventions hasn't been updated since sprint two, and nobody reads it anyway.

Code reviews catch some violations — but they're inconsistent, subjective, and already too late (the code is written). Manual audits happen quarterly if at all. Compliance is tracked in spreadsheets that are outdated the moment they're saved.

The result: governance through willpower. And willpower doesn't scale.

---

## The Solution

AI-GCE reads everything in your development workspace — steering files, team agreements, role isolation rules, the Definition of Done — and derives a tailored compliance enforcement layer. Hooks that fire when rules are violated. Agents that audit the codebase. Logs that provide evidence trails.

**Silent when compliant. Unmistakable when not.**

AI-GCE doesn't ask developers to follow rules. It makes violations impossible to miss — automatically, continuously, without human policing.

---

## How It Works

```
Development Workspace → Read Steering Files → Derive Rules + Hooks → Progressive Enforcement → Continuous Monitoring
```

**Four operating modes:**

| Mode | When | What Happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| Full Generation | New workspace | Reads all steering files, generates complete compliance layer |
| Re-Derivation | Steering changes | Detects what changed, updates affected rules/hooks only |
| Brownfield Adoption | Existing codebase | Baselines current violations, enforces on new code only |
| Tier Activation | Team ready to level up | Activates next compliance tier (progressive) |

---

## Who It's For

| Role | Pain Point Solved |
|------|-------------------|
| **Compliance Officer** | Automated enforcement with audit trails — compliance is proven, not claimed |
| **Tech Lead** | Standards enforced continuously — not dependent on catching violations in code review |
| **Platform Engineer** | Hook-based governance that deploys in minutes — no custom CI pipeline per rule |
| **Engineering Manager** | Team compliance visible in a dashboard — no quarterly manual audits |
| **Security Engineer** | Security-critical rules fire immediately on file save — not discovered in penetration testing |
| **New Team Member** | Instant feedback when violating a convention — learns the rules by trying to break them |

---

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Derived, Not Configured

AI-GCE reads existing steering files and derives enforcement automatically. You don't manually specify rules — the workspace already contains the answers. Technology stack, API standards, security rules, team topology — all read and transformed into enforceable hooks.

### 2. Two-Source Derivation

Not everything comes from steering files:
- **Steering-derived rules** (~40%) — project-specific enforcement from your architecture decisions
- **Built-in baseline** (~60%) — universal methodology rules (author ≠ approver, spec before code, no vibe-coding)

If your steering files are silent on a topic, you still get governance from the methodology baseline. No governance gaps.

### 3. Three-Tier Progressive Compliance

Never big-bang. Teams adopt gradually:

| Tier | Coverage | When |
|------|----------|------|
| Day 0 | 60-70% | Essential rules only — security, file structure, basic conventions |
| Sprint 2+ | 80-90% | Expanded enforcement — role isolation, session discipline, PR governance |
| Pre-Release | 92%+ | Full compliance — all rules active, all hooks firing |

### 4. Silent When Passing

Hooks produce zero output when rules pass. No notifications. No badges. No noise. Developers only hear from governance when something is wrong. Noise kills adoption.

### 5. Hook Debounce Strategy

Not all rules are equal:
- **Security-critical** → fires on `fileEdited` (immediate feedback)
- **Advisory/style** → fires on `agentStop` (batched, non-disruptive)

Classification is intentional and documented per hook.

### 6. Brownfield First-Class

Existing codebases get a baseline scan. Current violations are grandfathered as technical debt with an adoption plan. Enforcement starts on new/changed code from day one. No team is punished for history.

### 7. Full Audit Trail

Every hook execution writes a JSONL compliance event:
- Timestamp, rule ID, result (pass/fail), evidence, file affected
- Git-committed quarterly as compliance evidence
- Dashboard visualizes trend over time

## Part of AIFLC — the AI-* PDLC Family

AI-GCE is a Project-layer governance engine in the AI-* PDLC Family. It derives its compliance layer from a Development Workspace (from AI-DWG), then runs as a **continuous companion alongside AI-DLC v1** (Amazon's open-source AIDLC) — enforcing governance throughout delivery rather than as a one-time sequential stage. It works standalone too — if you have any workspace with `rules/` files, AI-GCE can derive a compliance layer from it regardless of how those files were created.

## Getting Started

See [setup/INSTALL.md](./setup/INSTALL.md) for platform-specific installation instructions.

**Activation:** After installation, start a chat and say:
```
Using AI-GCE, generate the compliance engine for this workspace
```
