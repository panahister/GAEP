# DFE State

**Marker for:** AI-DFE — AI-Driven Data Fabric
**Status:** {complete | active}

**Last full pass:** {ISO-8601}

> This file is DFE's single source of truth for what it has discovered and produced. It lives in `{family}-ws/data/`. Re-derivation may overwrite it — do not hand-edit.

## Field Notes

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `discovered.{pkg}.sourceFiles` | Cached at discovery; basis for monitor (2.4) staleness checks |
| `discovered.{pkg}.lastGenerated` | When `{pkg}-data.json` was last written; compared against source mtimes |
| `discovered.{pkg}.status` | `not-run` = sources absent (null data); `no-interface` = no data-schema/; `orphan` = package gone |
| `demands.{name}.schema` | DFE-owned aggregation schema validating this demand output |
| `demands.{name}.registered` | `true` = consumer is in `CONSUMER_REGISTRY.md` (shipped/installed); `false` = ad-hoc drop in `data/demands/` (user escape hatch) |
| `master.*` | Populated only when multiple families coexist (single-active master,) |
