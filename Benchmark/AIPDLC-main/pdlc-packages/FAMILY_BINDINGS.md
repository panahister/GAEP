## Internal Bindings (auto-derived from gate contracts)

> These edges form automatically via capability-type match within the family. Every `emits-type` matched by a sibling's `consumes-types` creates an edge.

### Internal Edge Table

| I-08 | AI-ADLC | `architecture-design@1` | AI-POLC | `architecture-design@^1` | `adlc-state.md` |
| I-09 | AI-ADLC | `architecture-design@1` | AI-DWG | `architecture-design@^1` | `adlc-state.md` |

> **AI-FLO is a wildcard observer, not a capability edge.** It consumes `"*"` (all types) as routing triggers — it reads every marker to track positions but forms no capability-typed edge. It is excluded from the edge table by design.

> **AI-DFE is also a wildcard observer, not a capability edge.** Like AI-FLO, it consumes `"*"` (all markers, plus each package's `SOURCE_MAP.md`) as gather triggers and forms no capability-typed edge. It **emits** `data-surface@1` (internal visibility) — consumed by tools/dashboards via `{family}-ws/data/REGISTRY.json`, not by sibling packages — so it appears in the chain summary as a data overlay but is excluded from the internal edge table by design.

### Fan-In Gates (from intra routing-policy)

| Consumer | Waits For | Gate Behavior |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| AI-DWG | AI-ADLC (terminal predecessor) | Validates AP + PBP + UXP all present (guaranteed by sequence: POLC→UXD→ADLC) |
| AI-UXD | AI-POLC | Sequential: waits for PBP complete before starting |
| AI-ADLC | AI-UXD | Sequential: waits for UXP complete before starting |
| AI-PPM | AI-ILC + AI-PILC | Accept any (registers both ideas and projects) |

> **Note on edge table vs. routing policy:** The internal edge table (above) shows all capability-type matches — these represent *potential* data flows. Some edges are **forward** (chain sequence: I-05→I-10→I-07→I-09), some are **feedback/enrichment** (I-03, I-04, I-07→AI-UXD, I-08→AI-POLC). The routing policy (sequential POLC→UXD→ADLC→DWG) determines the *order*; the edges determine what data flows where.

## External Bindings (from CROSS_FAMILY_FLOWS.md)

> These edges are explicitly declared. Each represents a cross-family seam. Optional = family always works without it (P4).

### Inbound — Neighbors That Feed PDLC

| Flow | From | Into | Type | Via Marker | Gate Controller | Optional |
|------|------|------|------|------------|-----------------|:--------:|
| FLOW-001 | BVLC · AI-BPLC | PDLC · AI-PILC | `validated-business-case@1` | `bplc-state.md` | `(BVLC) ai-bplc § Gate Contract` | ✅ |
| FLOW-002 | EAFLC · AI-TRM | PDLC · AI-ILC | `capability-input@1` | `trm-state.md` | `(EAFLC) ai-trm § Gate Contract` | ✅ |
| FLOW-008 | SXLC · AI-OKR | PDLC · AI-POLC | `enterprise-okr@1` | `okr-state.md` | `(SXLC) ai-okr § Gate Contract` | ✅ |
| FLOW-009 | SXLC · AI-SIP | PDLC · AI-PPM | `initiative-portfolio@1` | `sip-state.md` | `(SXLC) ai-sip § Gate Contract` | ✅ |

> FLOW-008/009 added 2026-07-13 — both families are built; SXLC's `FAMILY_BINDINGS.md` (E2/E3) asserted these active but PDLC's side was undeclared (gaps G1/G2). Now symmetric.

### Outbound — Neighbors PDLC Feeds

| Flow | From | To | Type | Via Marker | Gate Controller | Optional |
|------|------|----|------|------------|-----------------|:--------:|
| FLOW-003 | PDLC · AI-DWG | RUNFLC · AI-SLO | `development-workspace@1` | `dwg-state.md` | `ai-dwg § Gate Contract` | ✅ |
| FLOW-010 | PDLC · AI-PPM | SXLC · AI-SPR | `delivery-feedback@1` | `ppm-state.md` | `ai-ppm § Gate Contract` | ✅ |

> FLOW-010 added 2026-07-13 — closes gap G3 (SXLC AI-SPR declared this inbound loop-back; PDLC had no matching outbound declaration).

## Canonical Chain Summary

> This section replaces the hand-maintained family table for topology purposes. The diagram and edge table above are the authoritative routing graph. Package order reflects the sequential execution sequence.

| Portfolio | AI-ILC | lifecycle | `idea-decision@1` | (user raw idea) or `capability-input` (external) |
| Portfolio | AI-PILC | lifecycle | `project-initiation@1` | `idea-decision` or `validated-business-case` (external) or (user raw requirement) |
| Portfolio | AI-PPM | adaptive engine | `portfolio-state@1` | `project-initiation`, `idea-decision` |
| Edge | AI-FLO | active engine | `orchestration-state@1` | (all types — routing overlay) |

| Project | AI-TGE | companion engine | `test-strategy@1` | `development-workspace` |
| Overlay | AI-DFE | adaptive engine (data fabric) | `data-surface@1` | (all package markers + SOURCE_MAPs — data overlay; consumed by tools via `REGISTRY.json`) |
