## Dashboard Summary (machine-readable — AI-DFE reads this)

> Roll-up counts for the dashboard `ux` pane (UX tab). AI-DFE reads this when present and falls back to scanning/zeros otherwise. Keep current at Design/Validate/Assemble.

```yaml
dashboard-summary:
  designSystem:
    tokens:     { total: {N}, defined: {N} }
    components: { total: {N}, specified: {N} }
  wireframes:   { total: {N}, approved: {N}, inReview: {N}, pending: {N} }
  componentLibrary: { total: {N}, atoms: {N}, molecules: {N}, organisms: {N} }
  informationArchitecture: { status: "{in-progress | complete}", pages: {N} }
  accessibility: { wcagLevel: "{AA | AAA}", criteria: {N}, met: {N}, baselineDefined: {true|false} }
```

## Enabled Extensions (for downstream detection)

| Extension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Multi-Brand Theming | {Active / Inactive} |
| i18n/RTL | {Active / Inactive} |

---

## Input Sources

| Source | Path | Mode |
|--------|------|------|
| PIP | {path to pilc-state.md} | {A/B} |
| PBP | {path to polc-state.md} | {A only} |
| AP | {path to adlc-state.md} | {if present — adaptive constraint read} |
| Brief | {path or "verbal"} | {C} |
| Existing Design | {path} | {D} |

## Upstream Signals (same-layer peer reads — for re-entry detection)

| Peer | Signal | Last Seen | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| AI-POLC (`polc-state.md`) | Value goals / OKRs (focus research — OI-096) | {timestamp or "none"} | {value-goal summary used to focus research, or "absent"} |
| AI-ADLC (`adlc-state.md`) | `lastApStateSeen` — architecture constraints (Architecture→UX loop — OI-099) | {timestamp/hash or "none"} | On change after flows exist → trigger non-destructive constraint re-entry review |

> These track what each concurrent peer had produced when UXD last read it, so a later change (e.g., a late AP latency/data constraint, or updated POLC value goals) can be detected and reconciled. Absence never blocks.
