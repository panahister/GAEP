## The Problem

UX design in enterprise projects is either done too late or done in isolation. The architecture is designed without UX input. The backlog is prioritized without understanding user journeys. The development workspace is generated without design tokens or accessibility requirements. By the time a designer joins, the technical constraints have already locked out half the user experience they would have recommended.

The other extreme: a UX team produces beautiful deliverables — personas, journey maps, wireframes, design systems — that live in Figma and never reach the codebase. Developers implement their interpretation of the design. Nobody checks whether the final product matches the UX intent. The design system exists in two places: the design tool and the code — and they drift apart within a sprint.

## The Solution

AI-UXD integrates UX design into the AI-* delivery chain as a first-class parallel workflow. It runs alongside AI-ADLC and AI-POLC — feeding personas into product ownership, design tokens into the workspace generator, and accessibility baselines into governance.

**Design decisions that reach the code. Automatically.**

The AI acts as a UX Lead / Design Systems Architect. It guides the user through structured UX stages — personas, journey mapping, information architecture, user flows, design system definition, and accessibility baseline — producing artifacts that downstream packages consume directly.

## How It Works

```
PIP / AP → RESEARCH → ARCHITECTURE → DESIGN SYSTEM → ACCESSIBILITY → UX Design Package (UXP)
```

**Structured phases with cross-package exchange:**

| Phase | What Happens | Key Output |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Research | Define personas, map user journeys, identify pain points | Personas, Journey Maps |
| Architecture | Information architecture, navigation model, content hierarchy | IA Document, Sitemap |
| Flows | User flows, interaction patterns, task models | User Flow Diagrams, Interaction Specs |
| Design System | Tokens, component inventory, spacing/typography rules | Design System Specification |
| Accessibility | WCAG baseline, assistive tech requirements, testing criteria | Accessibility Baseline Document |

AI-UXD exchanges with AI-POLC at the strategy stage — personas and journeys inform backlog prioritization, and product value goals focus UX research.

## Who It's For

| Role | Pain Point Solved |
|------|-------------------|
| **UX Designer** | Structured lifecycle that integrates with engineering — deliverables reach the code, not just Figma |
| **Product Owner** | Personas and journeys that directly inform backlog prioritization — user-centered product decisions |
| **Frontend Developer** | Design tokens and component specs in the workspace from day 1 — no "ask the designer" |
| **Accessibility Engineer** | Baseline requirements defined upfront, not retrofitted after build — shift-left accessibility |
| **CTO / Tech Lead** | UX constraints visible alongside architecture constraints — informed trade-off decisions |

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Integrated, Not Isolated

AI-UXD doesn't produce deliverables that sit in a design tool. Its output feeds directly into:
- **AI-POLC** — personas and journeys inform product strategy and backlog prioritization
- **AI-DWG** — design tokens become workspace steering files (spacing, typography, color system)
- **AI-GCE** — accessibility baseline becomes governance rules (enforcement, not just documentation)

### 2. Parallel, Not Sequential

AI-UXD runs parallel to AI-ADLC and AI-POLC. It doesn't wait for architecture to finish before starting UX. The three packages inform each other during design: architecture reveals constraints, UX reveals user needs, product ownership reveals value priorities.

### 3. Design System as Code Contract

The design system output isn't a PDF — it's a structured specification that AI-DWG can translate into actual code tokens. Typography scales, color palettes, spacing units, and component inventories become enforceable standards in the development workspace.

### 4. Accessibility by Default

Accessibility isn't a phase gate at the end — it's a baseline established during UX design. AI-UXD defines WCAG targets, assistive technology support requirements, and testing criteria that flow into AI-GCE as governance rules and AI-TGE as test requirements.

## Position in AIFLC — the AI-* PDLC Family

AI-UXD sits in the **Project layer**, running in parallel with AI-ADLC and AI-POLC:
- Produces **UX Design Package (UXP)** → feeds AI-DWG alongside AP and PBP
- Exchanges with **AI-POLC** — personas/journeys flow to POLC; value goals focus UX research
- Receives feedback from **AI-DLC v1** — runtime learnings inform design iteration
- Feeds **AI-GCE** — accessibility baseline becomes enforcement rules

*AI-UXD — Because beautiful designs that never reach the code aren't design.*
