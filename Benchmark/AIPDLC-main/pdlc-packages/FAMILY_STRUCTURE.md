# AI-* Family — Complete Package & Output Structure

**Version:** 2.1.0
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Author:** Maheri

> **Amendment (2026-06-22 — family-workspace prefix + install split):** PART 2 runtime trees now nest all output under the family workspace `pdlc-ws/` (`pdlc-ws/projects/…`, `pdlc-ws/ideas/`, `pdlc-ws/portfolio/`, `pdlc-ws/data/`). See the install-lock design + `OUTPUT_AND_STATE_CONTRACT.md`.
>
> **Amendment (OI-158 — unified core placement):** cores + rule-details now install into ONE uniform home `.aiflc/{family}/` on every platform (superseding the earlier Kiro `.kiro/steering/{family}/` + `.kiro/{family}/` split); only the always-loaded orchestrator sits in each platform's native slot. See the "Installed Location" subsection in PART 1.
>
> **Amendment (OI-163 — single-copy fabric source):** the fabric engines **AI-FLO** and **AI-DFE** are no longer in-family dev-source folders. They exist as exactly ONE canonical engine copy in the build tree and are **cloned into the family at assemble** (stamped with the free-tier license set — INV-L4-007). PDLC therefore carries **no `ai-flo/` or `ai-dfe/` dev-source folder**; PART 1 now depicts them as cloned-at-assemble fabric, not built-here source. FLO/DFE remain valid family members — their chain contracts (PART 3) and runtime artifacts (PART 2) are unchanged.

```
  ¹ AI-DLC v1 = Amazon's open-source build lifecycle (not ours; we feed it).

| Layer | Package | Type | Input | Output |
|-------|---------|------|-------|--------|
| Portfolio | **AI-ILC** ² | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | Raw idea | Approved Idea Brief / Feature Brief |
| Portfolio | **AI-PILC** | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | Raw requirement | Project Initiation Package (PIP) |
| Portfolio | **AI-PPM** ³ | Adaptive portfolio engine | Multiple PIPs + Approved Idea Briefs | Portfolio register + cross-project prioritization & governance |
| Edge | **AI-FLO** ³ | Router / orchestration engine | Any package output marker | Routing decision + handoff to next package/layer |
| Project | **AI-POLC** ³ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP | Product Backlog Package (PBP) |
| Project | **AI-UXD** ³ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP + PBP | UX Design Package (UXP): personas/journeys, IA, user flows, design system + tokens, accessibility baseline |
| Project | **AI-ADLC** | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | PIP + PBP + UXP | Architecture Package (AP) |
| Project | **AI-DWG** | One-time generator | AP + PBP + UXP | Ready-to-code development workspace (DW) |
| Project | **AI-GCE** | Adaptive governance engine | DW (AI-DWG output) | Compliance enforcement layer |
| Project | **AI-TGE** | Test governance engine | DW / build artifacts | Test governance & quality layer |
| Project | **AI-DLC v1** ¹ | Interactive workflow (lifecycle) | DW + GCE + User Stories (from AI-POLC) | Working Software |

> ¹ **AI-DLC v1** ([awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows)) is NOT our product. Our chain produces the workspace AI-DLC v1 consumes.
> ² **AI-ILC** is an **optional pre-stage** (the funnel before the funnel). The chain still works without it for users who start at AI-PILC. `⇢` denotes the optional link.
> ³ All packages in this table are **built**. AI-PPM (portfolio engine), AI-FLO (router), AI-POLC (product ownership lifecycle), and AI-UXD (UX design lifecycle) were the last four — completed June 2026. Within the Project layer, **AI-POLC, AI-UXD, and AI-ADLC run sequentially** (POLC→UXD→ADLC) — each feeds the next, culminating at AI-DWG which receives all three outputs (AP + PBP + UXP). **AI-GCE and AI-TGE run alongside AI-DLC v1** as continuous quality engines; **AI-POLC ⇄ AI-DLC v1** exchange backlog/acceptance throughout delivery; and **AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flows back to both AI-UXD and AI-POLC**. Feedback loops (ADLC→POLC cost/risk, ADLC→UXD constraints) provide iterative refinement without changing the forward sequence.

> **AI-DWG Input semantics (peer-input model, OI-069 / decision 0.2 — 2026-06-15c):** The `AP + PBP + UXP` cell lists AI-DWG's three **peer inputs** (AP = AI-ADLC, PBP = AI-POLC, UXP = AI-UXD). It does **not** mean all three are required. AI-DWG accepts **any non-empty subset (≥1 of the three)** and generates only the output clusters whose input is present; absent inputs trigger a quality-impact disclosure + user approval (per `DWG_CONVERGENCE_DESIGN.md` Law 1). The cell text is kept **verbatim** as a compact input list — this note carries the semantics so no per-file table change/propagation is required.

---

## Naming & Ownership Convention

All file naming and provenance across the family follows one ratified convention:

> **See `contracts/NAMING_AND_OWNERSHIP.md` (the source of truth).**

**The A-dominant hybrid in one paragraph:** every generated `.md` artifact carries a provenance front-matter block (`generated-by`, `source`, `ownership: generated|hybrid|user`); hooks carry a `generatedBy` field. Filenames stay generic so artifacts read as the team's own — except *tool-owned* files, which are separated by **folder** (`.governance/`, `.kiro/hooks/`), never by filename prefix. Chain **marker files** (`pilc-state.md`, `adlc-state.md`, `workspace-rules.md`, the `.kiro/hooks/` folder) keep their exact names — renaming them breaks detection.

**Ownership legend** (used to annotate PART 2 below):

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[gen]` | Tool-generated; re-derivation may overwrite (`ownership: generated`) |
| `[hyb]` | Tool-seeded, team-edited; `<!-- custom -->` content preserved on re-derivation (`ownership: hybrid`) |
| `[tool]` | Tool-owned, in a dedicated folder; not hand-edited |
| `[marker]` | Chain detection anchor — name is non-negotiable |

---

## PART 1: Package Source Structure (What We Build & Publish)

> **These trees are compact by design** — they show each package's folder skeleton and key files, not every file. Each package's own `CONCEPTUAL_MAP.md` (navigation) and `PLAN.md` (rationale) hold the exhaustive, authoritative file list.

**Shared shell (every package).** All **9 domain packages** built in this family's dev tree ship the same outer shell, so it is shown once here and omitted from the per-package trees below. *(The two fabric engines — AI-FLO + AI-DFE — are cloned at assemble, not built here; see the "Fabric Engines" note below.)*

```
ai-{pkg}/
├── README.md  ·  LICENSE  ·  NOTICE                ← overview + Apache-2.0 + attribution
├── PLAN.md  ·  CONCEPTUAL_MAP.md                   ← rationale + navigation (authoritative file list)
├── USER_GUIDE.md  ·  WHITEPAPER.md                 ← end-user walkthrough + design narrative
├── ai-{pkg}-rules/        core-{workflow|engine|generator}.md   ← master orchestration (always loaded) + § Gate Contract
├── ai-{pkg}-rule-details/ common/ + {phase|concern folders}/ + data-schema/ + templates/
│                          └ data-schema/   {pkg}-data.schema.json + SOURCE_MAP.md + SCHEMA_README.md   ← AI-DFE data interface
└── setup/                 INSTALL.md               ← multi-platform install (Kiro, Cursor, Claude, …)
```

> **ROADMAP.md policy (eligibility-based):** `ROADMAP.md` is a package-root file that is **present only for a package that has opt-in extensions or deferred/planned features** (today: AI-ADLC, which ships a real extension roadmap). Every other package adds a `ROADMAP.md` **only if/when it acquires real forward plans** — never as boilerplate. The **absence** of a ROADMAP means "feature-complete for v1, nothing deferred" — an intentional, documented state, not a gap.

### Family Root Files

The family root (``) carries family-wide files alongside the package folders:

```

├── README.md  ·  LICENSE  ·  NOTICE  ·  CLA.md     ← family overview + license set
├── FAMILY_STRUCTURE.md                             ← this file (master structure reference)
├── FAMILY_TABLE_MAP.md                             ← canonical family table + registry
├── GATE_PROTOCOL.md            ← [Communication Fabric] universal gate & seam protocol (copied from canonical source)
├── FAMILY_INTERFACE.md         ← [Communication Fabric] public seam surface — Tier 1 seam packages + Tier 2 roster
├── FAMILY_BINDINGS.md          ← [Communication Fabric] generated topology — internal + external edges (do-not-edit)
├── TRIGGER_KEYS_REFERENCE.md                       ← destination-workspace trigger keys
├── MIGRATION_CATALOGUE.md                          ← output-feature migrations read by the UPG__ family upgrade agent
└── INSTALL_GUIDE_*.md                              ← per-platform install guides
```

> **Communication Fabric (the three new root files).** Every package declares a `§ Gate Contract` in its core file (capability types it emits/consumes + per-type field requirements). `GATE_PROTOCOL.md` defines the universal matching behavior; `FAMILY_INTERFACE.md` is the family's discoverable seam surface; `FAMILY_BINDINGS.md` is the generated routing graph (internal edges auto-derived from gate contracts + external cross-family edges). See `knowledge_docs/HOW_COMMUNICATION_FABRIC_WORKS.md`.

### Fabric Engines (AI-FLO + AI-DFE) — cloned at assemble, not in-family dev source

Per **OI-163 (single-copy fabric source)**, the two fabric engines are **not** built or published as in-family dev-source folders under this family. They exist as exactly ONE canonical engine copy in the build tree and are **cloned into the family at assemble** during `DEV__ promote` (stamped with the free-tier license set — INV-L4-007). PDLC therefore carries **no `ai-flo/` or `ai-dfe/` source folder**; the family's per-package `data-schema/` folders (shared shell above) remain the AI-DFE data interface.

| Fabric engine | Role (cloned form) | Presence in this family |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **AI-FLO** | Router / orchestration engine — `ai-flo-rules/core-engine.md` (3 phases / 10 stages, 3 topology modes) + `ai-flo-rule-details/` (configure · route · monitor · templates) + flow-integrity-agent (FIA__) | ⏳ Cloned at assemble |
| **AI-DFE** | Data fabric engine — `ai-dfe-rules/core-engine.md` + `ai-dfe-rule-details/` | ⏳ Cloned at assemble |

### Installed Location — Where Package Files Land (uniform `.aiflc/` home, all platforms)

The package **source** above (`ai-{pkg}-rules/` + `ai-{pkg}-rule-details/`) installs into ONE brand-scoped, family-scoped home that is **identical on every platform** (OI-158). Only the single always-loaded **orchestrator** sits in each platform's native auto-load slot; it `Read`s the relevant core on demand.

                                                   routes to.aiflc/pdlc/…/core-*.md on demand
```

- **Core + rule-details** → `.aiflc/{family}/{pkg}-rules/` and `.aiflc/{family}/{pkg}-rule-details/` — the SAME path on every platform. No Kiro split, no `{family}-` filename prefix, no `.amazonq/` nesting.
- **Orchestrator only** lands in each platform's native auto-load slot (Kiro `.kiro/steering/`, Claude `CLAUDE.md` `@import`, Cursor `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, Amazon Q `.amazonq/rules/`, Cline `.clinerules/`, Copilot/VS Code `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, Codex `AGENTS.md`).
- **Cores resolve rule-details from one canonical path**: `.aiflc/{family}/{pkg}-rule-details/` (standalone/flattened fallback: `{pkg}-rule-details/`).
- Runtime paths in the rules remain **workspace-root-relative** (`{family}-ws/…`).
- **Claude Code only** additionally gets generated `.claude/commands/pdlc/*.md` slash commands (destination triggers only) that `Read` the same cores under `.aiflc/pdlc/`.

## PART 2: Runtime Output Structure (What Each Package Produces When Run)

> **Ownership map** (per `contracts/NAMING_AND_OWNERSHIP.md`; legend defined above). Every generated `.md` carries the front-matter block from §5.2; every hook carries the `generatedBy` field from §5.3.
>
> | Package output | Default ownership | Notes |
> |---|---|---|
> | AI-ILC briefs + idea register | `[hyb]` | Team owns; `ilc-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-PILC docs (`project-initiation/`) | `[hyb]` | Team owns and edits; `pilc-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-PPM portfolio registers | `[hyb]` | Portfolio-scope; `ppm-state.md` is `[marker]` (NOT the per-project spine) |
> | AI-FLO routing artifacts | `[gen]` | Advisory routing records; `flo-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-ADLC docs (`architecture/`) | `[hyb]` | Team owns and edits; `adlc-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-UXD docs (`ux-design/`) | `[hyb]` | Team owns and edits; `uxd-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-POLC docs (`product-backlog/`) | `[hyb]` | Team owns and edits; `polc-state.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-DWG steering (`.kiro/steering/*.md`) | `[hyb]` | Living team docs; `workspace-rules.md` is `[marker]` |
> | AI-DWG AI-DLC v1 inputs (`vision.md`, `technical-environment.md`, …) | `[hyb]` | Assembled from peers; platform-independent |
> | AI-DWG config (`.editorconfig`, `docker-compose.yml`, …) | `[gen]` | Regenerated; ecosystem-standard names |
> | AI-GCE hooks (`.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook`) | `[tool]` | Folder boundary; carry `generatedBy` |
> | AI-GCE agents + governance docs (`.governance/`) | `[gen]` | Process agents + manual + registry; `<!-- custom -->` preserved |
> | AI-TGE outputs (`.tge/`) | `[gen]`/`[hyb]` | Strategy `[hyb]`, register/coverage `[gen]`; `tge-state.md` is `[marker]` |

When a user installs and runs these packages on their own project, each produces a distinct output cluster. **Reference docs** (PIP, AP, UXP, PBP) live in their own folders; **AI-DWG IS the workspace**; **AI-GCE and AI-TGE layer on top of it.**

### Multi-Project Layout (canonical — `OUTPUT_AND_STATE_CONTRACT.md`)

A workspace holds **many projects**. Every per-project producer nests its output in a **role folder** under a per-project root `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/`; the governance spine is their **sibling** at the project root; AI-DWG generates a per-project **dev workspace** opened separately. The sub-trees in the rest of PART 2 show each cluster's *internal* contents — in the multi-project layout they sit at the paths shown below.

> The legacy flat layout (output at workspace root, e.g. `project-initiation/`, `architecture/`) remains supported for **brownfield** — detected and offered a non-destructive restructure, never forced. The `projects/` layout is the always-on default for new work.

### AI-DWG output — the development workspace (peer-composed; generated at `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-…/{slug}-workspace/`)

AI-DWG composes the workspace from whichever **peers** are present — `{ADLC}`, `{POLC}`, `{UXD}`, or any combination (≥1). Each input owns a **distinct output cluster**; an absent input simply skips its cluster (with quality-impact disclosure + user approval). `workspace-rules.md` is always produced as the marker. The dev workspace is generated at `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/{slug}-workspace/` and **opened separately** in its own Kiro IDE to build; the per-project spine is **carried forward** into it (Option A).

> **Why the src folder is ADLC-gated is NOT dominance:** it is the same rule as `design-system.md` being UXD-gated and `vision.md` being POLC-gated — every output traces to exactly one input cluster, and no peer is privileged. (`DWG_CONVERGENCE_DESIGN.md` Laws 1-2.)

### AI-GCE + AI-TGE outputs — continuous companions (layer on top of the workspace)

Both run **alongside AI-DLC v1** (not as forward chain stages). They consume the DW and re-derive when the workspace updates.

Cross-layer hops are carried by **AI-FLO** (the router); same-layer exchanges are **direct marker reads**. The Project-layer design chain runs **sequentially** (AI-POLC → AI-UXD → AI-ADLC → AI-DWG) — each package feeds the next. Bidirectional flows: AI-FLO relays project status **up** to AI-PPM; AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flows **back** to AI-UXD + AI-POLC; AI-POLC ⇄ AI-DLC v1 exchange backlog/acceptance throughout delivery; an upstream-peer revision loops back through **AI-DWG Mode 2** (reconcile). **Feedback loops** (same-layer, no AI-FLO): ADLC loops cost/risk back to POLC and constraints back to UXD — these are non-destructive re-entry triggers that refine without changing the forward sequence. AI-DWG validates **all three inputs present** (guaranteed by the sequential model; fewer = brownfield user-approved exception).

### Input/Output Contract Summary

|---------|-----------|------------|--------------------|
| **AI-ILC** | Raw idea (any format) | `{idea-management}/` | `ilc-state.md` |
| **AI-PILC** | Raw requirement, or `ilc-state.md` (Approved Idea Brief) | `{project-initiation}/` | `pilc-state.md` |
| **AI-PPM** | `pilc-state.md` + Approved Idea Briefs (+ roll-up via AI-FLO) | `{portfolio}/` | `ppm-state.md` |

> `projectId` (camelCase) is the correlation key minted by AI-PILC and threaded through every downstream marker and the compliance/quality logs.

### Standalone vs. Chain Usage

Each package works **standalone** (the user is the orchestrator when AI-FLO is absent) OR as part of the chain:

| Package | Standalone Input | Chain Input |

## PART 4: Chain Contracts (Detection by Marker, Not by Path)

Each package is **contract-aware** — it knows what its predecessor(s) produce and what its successor expects. But paths are NEVER hardcoded. Users choose WHERE things go; packages define WHAT files must exist.

### Contract Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Detection by marker** | Look for a specific file name, not a specific folder path |
| **User owns WHERE** | Output folder location is always user's choice |
| **Package owns WHAT** | File names, state file schema, and internal structure are fixed |
| **Graceful standalone** | Every package works without the chain (accepts equivalent manual input) |
| **Format tolerant** | Supports both numbered docs and phase-folder structures from predecessors |
| **Cross-repo capable** | Predecessor output can be anywhere — different folder, repo, or drive |
| **Layered communication** | Cross-layer hops go via AI-FLO; same-layer exchanges are direct marker reads (L53) |

### Design Decision: Layered Communication & Bidirectional Flow

**Decision:** The AI-* family communicates by a **layered communication law**, not a strictly forward one-way chain. **Cross-layer** communication goes through **AI-FLO** (the router); **same-layer** communication is **direct marker reads**. Within that law, several **bidirectional** flows exist.

**The flows:**
- **Sequential Project-layer chain:** AI-PILC routes to AI-PPM (register · authorize), which dispatches to AI-POLC via AI-FLO. The Project-layer chain is **sequential: AI-POLC → AI-UXD → AI-ADLC → AI-DWG**. Each package feeds the next. By the time AI-ADLC completes (the terminal predecessor), all three inputs (PBP, UXP, AP) are guaranteed present for AI-DWG. For brownfield/partial scenarios (package skipped via profile), proceeding with fewer is a user-approved exception. If AI-PPM is absent, PILC degrades to AI-POLC directly.
- **Feedback loops (same-layer, direct — pre-build refinement):** AI-ADLC loops cost/risk bands back to AI-POLC (re-prioritization trigger) and architecture constraints back to AI-UXD (adjust flows). AI-UXD personas/journeys feed back to AI-POLC (backlog refinement). These are non-destructive re-entry triggers that refine without changing the forward sequence. Exchange is via direct peer marker reads (no AI-FLO — same layer). A peer-state change after work exists triggers a non-destructive reconciliation review.
- **Portfolio roll-up (up):** AI-FLO relays project status UP to AI-PPM; AI-PPM dispatches authorization DOWN via AI-FLO.
- **Runtime feedback (back):** AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flows back to **AI-UXD** + **AI-POLC**; **AI-POLC ⇄ AI-DLC v1** exchange backlog/acceptance throughout delivery.
- **Reconciliation loop (hinge):** when an upstream peer revises (often due to downstream feedback), the change loops back into the workspace through **AI-DWG Mode 2 (reconcile)**.
- **Continuous companions:** **AI-GCE** + **AI-TGE** run alongside AI-DLC v1 (not as sequential forward stages) and re-derive when the workspace updates.

**Standalone principle (unchanged):** every package still works alone. When AI-FLO is absent, the **user is the orchestrator** — cross-layer coordination degrades to manual handoff, while same-layer marker detection works regardless. AI-FLO is additive coordination, never a single point of failure.

**Why this superseded the old "one-directional signal flow" model:** automated, multi-package coordination became a real requirement (portfolio governance, parallel Project-layer packages, runtime feedback). The router (AI-FLO) provides the coupling without breaking standalone usage — the concern the original one-way decision was protecting against.

## PART 5: Reconciliation & Signal Flow

AI-DWG is the **hinge** of the family's change loop: it runs **forward (Mode 1: generate)** from the present peers, and **reverse-triggered (Mode 2: reconcile)** when an upstream peer revises — typically because AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flowed back to AI-UXD or AI-POLC (or a tech lesson reached AI-ADLC). When the workspace updates, **AI-GCE and AI-TGE both re-derive** the affected hooks/rules and test register.

**Directionality rule:** the only feedback that crosses back *through AI-DWG* is an **upstream-peer revision (Mode 2)**. AI-DLC v1's internal loops stay inside `aidlc-docs/`; GCE/TGE findings can *trigger* a human upstream revision but never *author* upstream content.
