📈 Extension available: Benefits Realization Aggregation

This adds to Stages 8 and 10:
• Cross-project benefits tracking (delivered vs. promised across portfolio)
• Benefits realization curve (how value accumulates over time)
• Value-gap analysis (projects consuming budget without delivering benefits)
