# AI-PPM Extensions

**Purpose:** Optional capabilities that extend AI-PPM's core 10-stage engine with advanced portfolio management patterns. Extensions are opt-in — they activate only when triggered by user request, portfolio context, or depth level.

## Extension Inventory

| ID | Extension | Stage(s) | Trigger | What It Adds |
|:--:|-----------|:--------:|---------|--------------|
| E1 | Portfolio Balancing & Visualization | 4, 8 | "balance" / "portfolio mix" / >10 projects / Comprehensive | Bubble charts, horizon distribution, risk-spread, balance guardrails |
| E2 | What-If Scenario Modeling | 9 | "what-if" / "scenario" / capacity constraints | Scenario comparison, trade-off analysis, impact prediction |
| E3 | Cross-Project Dependency Mapping | 4, 7 | >5 projects / shared resources / "dependencies" | Dependency graph, critical path across projects, blocked-by chains |
| E4 | Portfolio-Level Capacity & Demand | 3, 8 | "capacity" / "resource contention" / >3 shared teams | Supply vs. demand visualization, over-allocation alerts |
| E5 | Investment Themes / Strategic Buckets | 3 | "investment themes" / "strategic buckets" / formal budget categories | Budget allocation by category, distribution enforcement |
| E6 | Financial Governance | 5, 8 | "budget" / "funding" / "financial governance" / enterprise | Lean budget guardrails, funding approval thresholds, portfolio ROI |

## How Extensions Work

1. **Opt-in files** (`{name}.opt-in.md`) are scanned at engine start — one paragraph each
2. If trigger condition is met → present activation prompt to user
3. On "yes" → load full detail file (`{name}.md`)
4. Extension adds sub-steps to affected stage(s) — **additive, never replacing** core steps
5. Active extensions recorded in `ppm-state.md` → Active Extensions field

## Activation Rules

- Extensions can be activated at any time (not just engine start)
- User can say "activate {extension}" mid-session
- Extensions can be deactivated: "deactivate {extension}" — stops adding sub-steps
- Multiple extensions can be active simultaneously (no conflicts by design)
- At Comprehensive depth, all contextually-relevant extensions auto-suggest
