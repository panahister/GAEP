# AI-PPM — Content Validation Rules

**Purpose:** Define quality standards for all AI-PPM output. Every artifact produced by this engine must meet these rules before being presented to the user.

---

## Universal Rules (Apply to ALL Output)

### 1. Portfolio Scope Only

- Every statement must be about the **portfolio as a whole** or about **projects in comparison to each other**
- Never produce single-project analysis (that's PILC/POLC/ADLC territory)
- Test: "Does this require knowledge of multiple projects?" If no → wrong scope

### 2. No Project-Specific Content in Templates

- Templates use `{placeholder}` for values filled during generation
- Templates use `_[TBD]_` for values the user provides later
- Zero hardcoded project names, dates, budgets, or team names in any template
- Test: "Could I use this template for any portfolio?" If no → too specific

### 3. Provenance Front-Matter (Mandatory)

Every generated `.md` file must include:

```yaml
---
generatedBy: AI-PPM
generatedVersion: 1.0.0
source: {upstream-doc-path or "portfolio-governance"}
generatedOn: {ISO-date}
ownership: generated | hybrid | user
---
```

### 4. Source-Driven — Never Fabricate Data

- All portfolio data must trace back to: PIP sources (read from `pilc-state.md`), ILC briefs, FLO roll-ups, or user-provided information
- Never invent project status, budget figures, risk scores, or health indicators
- If data is unavailable, state: "Data not available — manual update needed" (never guess)

### 5. Quantified Over Qualitative

- Prefer numbers over adjectives: "3 of 7 projects are at-risk" over "several projects have issues"
- Always include the denominator: "4/10 aligned" not "4 aligned"
- Scores must show the scale: "Strategic alignment: 18/25" not just "18"

### 6. Comparative Framing

- When discussing a project, always relate it to the portfolio: "ranks #3 of 8" not just "high priority"
- Dashboard views must show all projects (or a meaningful subset) — never just one in isolation
- Governance decisions must state impact on OTHER projects: "admitting X delays Y by 2 sprints"

---

## Artifact-Specific Rules

### Portfolio Register

- Every row must have: Project ID, Name, State, Priority Rank, Strategic Alignment Score, Health (RAG), Last Updated
- States are ONLY: `Registered` | `Prioritized` | `Authorized` | `Active` | `Paused` | `Retired`
- Priority rank must be unique (no ties without explicit tie-breaking rationale)
- "Last Updated" reflects the most recent data refresh (from FLO or manual)

### Governance Decision Records

- Must include: Decision type, Project affected, Rationale, Conditions, Review date
- Rationale must reference at least one data point (score, threshold, comparison)
- Must state WHO made the decision (user, portfolio manager)
- Must state WHAT changes as a result (state transition, resource release, etc.)
- Sequential numbering: PGD-001, PGD-002, …

### Prioritization Scorecard

- Must show the model used (Value/Effort, Weighted, WSJF, etc.)
- Must show per-project scores on each dimension
- Must show the composite calculation
- Must show the resulting rank order
- If a rank differs from pure score (governance override), state the override rationale

### Portfolio Dashboards

- Must have a generation timestamp
- Must show the data source (FLO roll-up vs. manual entry) per project
- Must flag stale data (>2 weeks since last refresh)
- Must include executive summary (3-5 bullet points) before detail tables
- RAG colors: 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Off Track | ⚪ No Data

### Dispatch Authorizations

- Must include: Project ID, Priority Rank, Authorization Scope, Constraints, Required Packages
- Must be self-contained — FLO reads only this document, not the full portfolio
- Must reference the governance decision that authorized it (PGD-{NNN})

### Strategic Alignment Map

- Must show organizational objectives (rows) × projects (columns)
- Must show per-cell alignment score
- Must show weighted total per project
- Must highlight low-alignment projects (candidates for retirement)

## Cross-Reference Integrity

| When Referencing | Verify |
|---|---|
| A project's budget | Matches the value in PIP (from `pilc-state.md`) |
| A project's health | Matches the latest FLO roll-up (or manual update) |
| A governance decision | PGD-{NNN} exists in `portfolio-decisions/` |
| Strategic objectives | Match the list in `ppm-state.md` |
| Priority rank | Matches `prioritization-scorecard.md` |

## Validation Checklist (Run Before Presenting Any Artifact)

- [ ] Portfolio scope (not single-project analysis)
- [ ] No hardcoded project names in templates
- [ ] Provenance front-matter present
- [ ] All data traceable to source (PIP, FLO, user input)
- [ ] Numbers have denominators and scales
- [ ] Projects shown in comparative context
- [ ] Cross-references are valid
- [ ] No `{placeholder}` left unresolved in generated output (only in templates)
- [ ] No `_[TBD]_` left unresolved without flagging to user
- [ ] Governance cadence respected (appropriate frequency for the action)

---

*Apply these rules to every output. They ensure AI-PPM produces governance-grade artifacts, not casual summaries.*
