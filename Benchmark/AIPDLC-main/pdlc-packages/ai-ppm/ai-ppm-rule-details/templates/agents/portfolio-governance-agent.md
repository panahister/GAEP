## Checks (16 total, 4 categories)

### Portfolio Currency (PC1–PC4)

1. **PC1 — Register freshness:** Is `portfolio-register.md` updated within the last 2 weeks? Check "Last Updated" timestamps per project.
2. **PC2 — State file currency:** Does `ppm-state.md` reflect actual portfolio composition? Cross-check project count against register.
3. **PC3 — Roll-up recency:** When was the last FLO roll-up ingested? Flag if >2 weeks stale.
4. **PC4 — Cadence adherence:** Are scheduled reviews (biweekly sync, monthly health, quarterly strategic) happening on time?

### Governance Completeness (GC1–GC4)

5. **GC1 — All projects have a state:** Every register entry has a valid state (not blank or "unknown").
6. **GC2 — All active projects have a governance decision:** Every Active project has a PGD-{NNN} record.
7. **GC3 — All active projects have a dispatch authorization:** Every Active project has a DA-{ID} file.
8. **GC4 — Strategic alignment scored:** All prioritized/active projects have alignment scores (not "pending").

### Decision Quality (DQ1–DQ4)

9. **DQ1 — Decisions have rationale:** Every PGD record includes a non-empty Rationale section.
10. **DQ2 — Decisions have review dates:** Every PGD record has a Review Date set.
11. **DQ3 — Overdue reviews:** Any governance decision past its Review Date without re-assessment?
12. **DQ4 — Priority model documented:** Prioritization scorecard exists and states the model used.

### Health Monitoring (HM1–HM4)

13. **HM1 — Dashboard exists:** `portfolio-health-dashboard.md` exists and is <30 days old.
14. **HM2 — No unactioned anomalies:** Any flagged anomalies from last ingestion still unresolved?
15. **HM3 — Retired projects have records:** Every Retired project has a retirement record.
16. **HM4 — Management framework contribution:** PPM entries exist in the governance spine Decision_Log.
