# Coverage Reporting

## Stage: 9 of 12
## Phase: 🟢 OBSERVATION
## Execution: ALWAYS (in Observation Phase)

---

## Purpose

Generate a multi-dimensional **Coverage Report** showing how well the project's actual tests match the required tests in the register. Coverage is calculated from register data (tests existing / tests required) — this is commitment-based coverage, not line-of-code coverage. The report provides multiple views to help teams understand WHERE gaps exist, not just that gaps exist.

---

## Depth Adaptation

| Depth | Report Scope | Views Provided |
|-------|-------------|:-------------:|
| **Minimal** | Single overall percentage + category breakdown. Top 5 gaps listed. No trend data. | 2 views (overall + by category) |
| **Standard** | Multi-view: by commitment, by component, by test type, by risk level. Gap list with specific entry details. Trend data if prior reports exist. | 4 views + trend |
| **Comprehensive** | All Standard views + traceability matrix + heat map by component + historical trend chart + coverage velocity (rate of improvement) + forecasting ("at current pace, 80% coverage in {n} sprints"). | 6+ views + trend + forecast |

---

## MANDATORY: Stage Sub-Role — Audit Specialist

During THIS stage, ALSO adopt the mindset of an **Audit Specialist**. This does NOT replace your primary role (Senior QA Engineer / Test Architect) — it ADDS a thinking dimension.

### Behavioral Shifts
- Report facts, not opinions — "42% coverage" not "coverage is concerning"
- Present multiple views because different stakeholders need different angles (dev team needs component view; PM needs risk view; architect needs commitment view)
- Calculate precisely — exclude Deprecated and Overridden from denominators
- Compare against TARGETS (from test strategy) — not just raw numbers

### Anti-Patterns for This Stage
- Do NOT claim 100% coverage without verifying every entry Status = Exists
- Do NOT present a single percentage as "the" coverage number — always contextualize
- Do NOT hide low coverage — the point of governance is transparency
- Do NOT include Deprecated/Overridden entries in calculations — they're excluded by design

### Quality Check
A good output at this stage sounds like:
- "Overall coverage: 58% (39/67 active entries). By risk: Critical = 67% (2/3 gaps addressed), High = 50%, Medium = 62%, Low = 45%. By component: PaymentService = 33% (highest-risk area), UserService = 75%, OrderService = 60%. Trend: +13% since last report (3 tests added in Sprint 4). At current velocity, 80% target in ~2 sprints."

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Calculate Base Metrics

From the current test register:

```markdown
## Metric Definitions

Active entries = Total - Deprecated - Overridden
Coverage % = (Exists + Failing*) / Active entries × 100

* Failing tests COUNT as covered (test exists, just needs fixing).
  They're tracked separately but don't penalize coverage %.
  ONLY Missing entries are true gaps.
```

| Metric | Formula | Value |
|--------|---------|:-----:|
| Total register entries | Count all | {N} |
| Deprecated | Status = Deprecated | {n} |
| Overridden | Status = Overridden | {n} |
| **Active entries** | Total - Deprecated - Overridden | **{N}** |
| Exists | Status = Exists or Exists (unverified) | {n} |
| Failing | Status = Failing | {n} |
| Missing | Status = Missing or Required | {n} |
| **Coverage %** | (Exists + Failing) / Active × 100 | **{n}%** |

---

### Step 2: Generate View — By Architectural Commitment

Group register entries by commitment category:

```markdown
## Coverage by Commitment Category

| Category | Active | Covered | Missing | Coverage % | Target | Gap to Target |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------------:|
| API | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {from strategy} | {±n}% |
| Security | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Business Logic | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Integration | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Data | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Performance/NFR | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Workflow | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
| Configuration | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {target} | {±n}% |
```

---

### Step 3: Generate View — By Component

Group by architectural component:

```markdown
## Coverage by Component

| Component | Active | Covered | Missing | Coverage % | Risk Exposure |
|-----------|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
| {ComponentName} | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {sum of missing risk scores} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Most at-risk component:** {component} (coverage {n}%, risk exposure {score})
**Best-covered component:** {component} (coverage {n}%)
```

---

### Step 4: Generate View — By Test Level

Distribution across the test pyramid:

```markdown
## Coverage by Test Level

| Level | Active | Covered | Missing | Coverage % | Pyramid Target |
|-------|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----------:|:--------------:|
| Unit | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {n}% |
| Integration | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {n}% |
| System | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {n}% |
| Acceptance | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {n}% |

**Pyramid health:** {Assessment — e.g., "Heavy on unit tests, integration gap"}
```

---

### Step 5: Generate View — By Risk Level

Coverage within each risk bucket:

```markdown
## Coverage by Risk Level

| Risk Bucket | Active | Covered | Missing | Coverage % | Interpretation |
|-------------|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----------:|---------------|
| 🔴 Critical | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {comment: "2 Critical gaps remain — highest priority"} |
| 🟠 High | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {comment} |
| 🟡 Medium | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {comment} |
| 🟢 Low | {n} | {n} | {n} | {n}% | {comment} |

**Risk-weighted coverage:** Critical risks at {n}% is {"acceptable" / "concerning" / "critical gap"}
```

---

### Step 6: Trend Analysis (If Prior Report Exists)

Compare to previous coverage report:

```markdown
## Coverage Trend

| Metric | Previous | Current | Delta | Direction |
|--------|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---------:|
| Overall coverage | {n}% | {n}% | {±n}% | {↑/→/↓} |
| Critical gaps | {n} | {n} | {±n} | {↑/→/↓} |
| High gaps | {n} | {n} | {±n} | {↑/→/↓} |
| Total active entries | {n} | {n} | {±n} | — |

**Period:** {previous date} → {current date}
**Velocity:** {n} tests added per sprint (average)
```

**Comprehensive depth — forecast:**
```markdown
## Coverage Forecast

At current velocity ({n} tests per sprint):
- 70% coverage: ~{n} sprints
- 80% coverage: ~{n} sprints
- 90% coverage: ~{n} sprints

**Bottleneck:** {category/component with slowest progress}
**Recommendation:** {prioritize X to unblock Y}
```

---

### Step 7: Identify Specific Gaps

List the most important missing tests:

```markdown
## Top Gaps — Immediate Attention

| # | ID | Test Name | Component | Risk Score | Bucket |
|---|:--:|-----------|-----------|:----------:|:------:|
| 1 | {id} | {name} | {comp} | {score} | 🔴 |
| 2 | {id} | {name} | {comp} | {score} | 🔴 |
| 3 | {id} | {name} | {comp} | {score} | 🟠 |
| 4 | {id} | {name} | {comp} | {score} | 🟠 |
| 5 | {id} | {name} | {comp} | {score} | 🟠 |
```

---

### Step 8: Compile Coverage Report

```markdown
# Coverage Report

**Type:** Coverage Report
**Generated:** {ISO timestamp}
**Engine:** AI-TGE v1.0.0
**Mode:** {mode}
**Depth:** {depth level}

## Executive Summary
- **Overall coverage:** {n}% ({n}/{n} active entries)
- **Critical gaps:** {n} remaining
- **Trend:** {↑ Improving / → Stable / ↓ Declining} ({±n}% since last report)
- **Target:** {n}% (from test strategy)
- **Gap to target:** {n}%

{View 1: By Commitment Category}
{View 2: By Component}
{View 3: By Test Level}
{View 4: By Risk Level}
{View 5: Trend — if prior data exists}
{View 6: Top Gaps}
```

Save to `.governance/test/coverage-report.md` (overwrites previous — each report is a current snapshot).

---

### Step 9: Present Summary

```markdown
## 🟢 Coverage Report Generated

**Overall:** {n}% coverage ({n}/{n} active requirements)
**Vs. target:** {n}% gap to {target}%
**Critical gaps:** {n} remaining
**Trend:** {direction} ({±n}% since last)

**Key insight:** {One sentence: what's the most important thing the team should know?}
- Example: "PaymentService is the biggest risk: 33% coverage with 3 Critical-risk gaps"
- Example: "All Critical tests now exist — focus on High-priority integration tests"

**Full report:** `.governance/test/coverage-report.md`

---

**Your response:**
- (a) **Acknowledge** — I've seen the coverage; continue observation
- (b) **Drill down** — show me details for {component/category}
- (c) **Reprioritize** — I want to adjust which gaps we address first
- (d) **Override** — I want to accept certain gaps (mark as Overridden)
```

---

## Gate

**Soft gate.** Coverage reporting presents results for review. The user CAN acknowledge and continue without action. But if coverage is below target and Critical gaps exist, highlight this clearly.
