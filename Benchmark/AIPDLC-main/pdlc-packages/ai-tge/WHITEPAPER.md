## The Problem

Software teams write tests. But nobody governs whether the RIGHT tests exist.

The typical pattern: a team achieves 80% code coverage and declares victory. But code coverage doesn't answer: "Did we test the things the architecture promised?" The API contract specified 5 error codes — only 2 have tests. The security ADR mandated token refresh handling — no test exists. The integration map shows 4 external systems — timeout tests exist for 1.

Line coverage measures quantity. Architecture coverage measures accountability. Most teams have the first. Almost none have the second.

The result: production incidents caused by things the architecture explicitly decided but nobody verified. Not because the team was negligent — because there's no mechanism connecting architecture decisions to test obligations.

---

## The Solution

AI-TGE reads the Architecture Package — every API contract, every ADR, every security decision, every integration map — and derives a structured register of tests that MUST exist to verify those promises were kept. Then it watches the build, tracking what gets tested and what doesn't, scoring the risk of every gap.

**Architecture in, test obligations out. Gaps visible. Risk scored.**

The AI acts as a Senior QA Engineer / Test Architect. It doesn't write tests — it governs what tests SHOULD exist, tracks whether they do, and prioritizes which missing tests matter most by architectural risk.

---

## How It Works

```
AP + DW → STRATEGY (derive what must be tested) → OBSERVATION (track what gets tested) → Continuous Governance
```

**Two phases, 12 stages:**

| Phase | What Happens | Key Output |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 🔵 Strategy | Read architecture, derive test requirements, assess existing tests, generate strategy, score risk | Test Register, Test Strategy, Debt Scorecard |
| 🟢 Observation | Watch the build, track test existence, report coverage, reconcile architecture changes, reassess debt | Coverage Report, Updated Register, Defect Log |

The Strategy phase runs once (or on architecture changes). The Observation phase runs continuously — every time AI-TGE is invoked, it checks what's new and updates coverage.

## Who It's For

| Role | Pain Point Solved |
|------|-------------------|
| **QA Lead / Test Architect** | Structured governance: know exactly what tests must exist and which are missing — not guesswork |
| **Senior Developer** | Clear test obligations per component — "you built PaymentService, here are the 7 tests it needs" |
| **CTO / VP Engineering** | Architecture accountability: every design decision has a verification chain — or a visible gap |
| **Scrum Master** | Sprint planning with test debt visibility — "3 Critical-risk tests need writing before release" |
| **Compliance Officer** | Audit trail: every test requirement traces to an architecture commitment — verifiable governance |

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Architecture-Driven, Not Coverage-Metric-Driven

AI-TGE doesn't measure "did we test enough code?" It measures "did we test what we designed?" Every test requirement traces to a specific architectural commitment — an API contract, an ADR, a security decision, an integration map. Coverage is measured against promises, not against lines.

### 2. Two-Source Model

Even if the architecture is thin or silent on a topic, a built-in baseline of 20 universal test rules ensures minimum governance. API endpoints need contract tests. Auth flows need security tests. Data mutations need integrity tests. The baseline provides the floor; architecture provides the specifics.

### 3. Risk-Scored Debt

Not all missing tests are equal. AI-TGE scores every gap on four factors: Architectural Risk × Blast Radius × Logic Complexity × Change Frequency. The result: a prioritized scorecard that tells the team exactly which test to write next for maximum risk reduction.

### 4. Four Input Modes

AI-TGE adapts to what exists:
- **Full Chain** — AP + DW + running build (full strategy + observation)
- **Architecture Only** — AP exists but no build yet (strategy derivation)
- **Brownfield** — Existing tests but no AP (map → gap → prioritize)
- **Observation Only** — Build in progress, no prior TGE run (track from now)

### 5. Governs, Doesn't Write

AI-TGE is NOT a test generator. It identifies WHAT tests must exist, tracks WHETHER they do, and prioritizes WHICH gaps to address. The team writes the actual tests. AI-TGE ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

## Position in AIFLC — the AI-* PDLC Family

AI-TGE is a **companion package** in the Project layer — it runs alongside AI-DLC v1 (with AI-GCE) as a continuous quality engine:
- Reads from **AI-ADLC** (Architecture Package — what was promised)
- Reads from **AI-DWG** (Development Workspace — what tools are available)
- Observes **AI-DLC v1** (build progress — what's being implemented)
- Complements **AI-GCE** (GCE governs code/process compliance; TGE governs test completeness)

AI-GCE asks "is the code compliant?" AI-TGE asks "is the testing sufficient?"

*AI-TGE — Because "80% coverage" doesn't mean "tested what matters."*
