# AI-DWG — Installation Guide

## Recommended: Family Installer

The easiest way to install AI-DWG is via the AI-* Family installer (from the family root folder):

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\installer\install.ps1 -TargetWorkspace "C:\path\to\your\project" -Platform kiro -Packages "ai-dwg"
```

### macOS / Linux
```bash
./installer/install.sh --target ~/path/to/your/project --platform kiro --packages ai-dwg
```

The installer places package files in the correct location for your platform and creates the family workspace (`pdlc-ws/`) where AI-DWG writes its output.

---

## What Gets Installed (Kiro example)

```
your-workspace/
├── .kiro/
│   └── steering/
│       └── session-orchestrator.md           ← the ONLY always-loaded file (routes to cores)
├── .aiflc/
│   └── pdlc/
│       ├── ai-dwg-rules/core-generator.md   ← core, read on demand by the orchestrator
│       └── ai-dwg-rule-details/             ← rule details, read on demand by the core
└── pdlc-ws/                                  ← AI-DWG OUTPUT lands here (created by installer)
```

> **The AIFLC model:** the session orchestrator is the only always-loaded file (it sits in Kiro's `.kiro/steering/` slot); the package core and its rule-details live together in the uniform home `.aiflc/pdlc/`, read on demand. The `.aiflc/pdlc/` layout is identical on every platform.

---

## Manual Install (Per Platform)

If you prefer manual install, copy the package core to `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rules/core-generator.md` and the rule-details to `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rule-details/` (identical on every platform), then place the **session orchestrator** — the only always-loaded file — in your platform's native slot:

| Platform | Session orchestrator (always-loaded) → |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/session-orchestrator.md` |
| Amazon Q | `.amazonq/rules/pdlc/session-orchestrator.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/pdlc-session-orchestrator.mdc` (with `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter) |
| Cline | `.clinerules/pdlc-session-orchestrator.md` |
| Claude Code | root `CLAUDE.md` importing `@CLAUDE_PDLC_ORCHESTRATOR.md` |
| Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (orchestrator block) |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` (orchestrator block) |

The core (`core-generator.md`) and `ai-dwg-rule-details/` are plain copies under `.aiflc/pdlc/` on every platform — there are no per-package `.mdc`, `.instructions.md`, or `CLAUDE_PDLC_AI_*` files anymore.

---

## Verify

1. Open your workspace in your IDE.
2. Confirm the core file loads as steering (Kiro: check the Steering panel).
3. Start a chat: "Using AI-DWG, generate the development workspace from my architecture package".
4. AI-DWG output appears under `pdlc-ws/`.

---

## Notes

- The session orchestrator is always-loaded; the package core and rule-details load on demand.
- AI-DWG coexists with other AI-* packages — each is family-scoped under `.aiflc/pdlc/`. Run AI-ADLC first for architecture, then AI-DWG to generate the workspace.
- AI-DWG generates new steering files but never modifies manually-created ones.
- Runtime output is written under `pdlc-ws/`, never at the workspace root.

---

## Usage

### First Time (Full Generation)

```
Using AI-DWG, generate the development workspace from my architecture package.
The AP is located at: <path-to-architecture-package>
```

AI-DWG will read your Architecture Package, ask its configuration questions, and generate all workspace files in one pass.

> **Two things to distinguish:**
> - **Installing DWG** (this guide) = where DWG's own core-generator steering goes so *you* can run it. Use `-Platform` to match the IDE *you* run DWG in.
> - **DWG's output platform targeting** = a **generation-time question** DWG asks (Config Gate Q2): *"What AI platform(s) will be used in the generated workspace?"* You may pick **one or several** (kiro, claude-code, cursor, codex, generic). DWG produces a canonical `rules/` folder plus one thin **adapter per selected platform** (`.kiro/steering/`, `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, or a generic `WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md`). Multi-target is supported — a team split across Kiro + Cursor gets both adapters over one shared `rules/`.
>
> These are independent: you might run DWG in Kiro but generate a workspace targeting Cursor + Claude Code.

### After Architecture Changes (Reconciliation)

```
Using AI-DWG, reconcile the workspace — the API Architecture was updated.
```

AI-DWG will detect what changed, propose workspace updates, and apply approved changes (preserving your customizations).

### Brownfield Overlay (Existing Codebase)

```
Using AI-DWG, add governance to this existing workspace.
```

AI-DWG will detect existing files and conventions, generate steering files (safe — new), merge configs additively (never overwrite), and skip existing operational docs.

---

## Compatibility

- **AI-ADLC v1.0:** Full support (core workflow output)
- **AI-ADLC v1.1:** Full support (6 extensions detected automatically)
- **Standalone AP:** Supported (without `adlc-state.md` — manual artifact mapping required)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| AI doesn't find rule-details | Ensure the rule-details folder is at the correct location for your platform (see Manual Install) |
| Extensions not detected | Verify `adlc-state.md` exists in the AP folder with an `Enabled Extensions` section |
| Conditional files not generated | Check that the AP contains the trigger artifact (see core-generator conditional logic table) |
| Reconciliation overwrites customizations | Ensure team-added content is NOT placed between `<!-- begin: AP-sourced -->` markers |

---

## Test Mode (Optional)

AI-DWG includes a built-in **test mode** for capturing feedback (bugs, improvements, root-cause analyses) during package usage. Test mode is entirely optional and does not affect normal operation.

### Kiro IDE

Test mode ships automatically with the package's rule-details — the file lives at `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rule-details/common/test-mode.md` on every platform (Kiro included). Nothing extra is installed for Kiro.

It is **not** auto-loaded and does **not** appear in Kiro's Steering panel — nothing under `.aiflc/` auto-loads.

**To activate:** tell the active package "enable test mode" (or "load test mode"). It reads `test-mode.md` from its rule-details home on demand and starts offering the optional feedback checkpoints.

### Amazon Q Developer / Cursor / Cline / Claude Code / Copilot / Codex

No manual copy needed — `test-mode.md` is installed with the package under `.aiflc/pdlc/ai-dwg-rule-details/common/`, the same on every platform.

Activate it the same way: tell the AI "enable test mode". It reads `test-mode.md` from the rule-details home on demand and starts offering the optional feedback checkpoints.

### What Test Mode Does

- Adds brief feedback checkpoints after each phase (non-blocking — always skippable)
- Assists in filling structured bug/improvement/RCA templates via conversation
- Saves findings to a local `test-feedback-outbox/` folder (gitignored, never transmitted)
- Submission to maintainers is 100% manual and opt-in

### Privacy

- ❌ No network calls, no telemetry, no data collection
- ❌ No PII fields in templates
- ✅ All data stays local until you manually submit
- ✅ Review obligation rests entirely with you (the end user)

See `TEST_MODE_USER_GUIDE.md` (in this folder) for the full user guide.
