# Mapping: Architecture Package + UXP → architecture/technical-environment.md (ADLC CLUSTER)

## Purpose

Assembles the **Technical Environment Document** that AI-DLC v1 expects as one of its two primary human-authored inputs. This document answers "What tools and constraints define our build environment?" — combining technology decisions from AI-ADLC with frontend patterns from AI-UXD.

**Output:** `{workspace-root}/architecture/technical-environment.md`

**Condition:** Generate IF `adlc-state.md` is present (ADLC peer input detected).

**Enrichment:** If `uxd-state.md` is ALSO present, the Frontend Patterns section is enriched with design system references, component library specification, and token format.

**Cluster:** Tech (primary) + UX (frontend enrichment)

---

## MANDATORY: Stage Sub-Role — Systems Engineer

During THIS activity, ALSO adopt the mindset of a **Systems Engineer**. This does NOT replace your primary role (DevOps/Platform Engineer + Senior Architect) — it ADDS a thinking dimension.

### Behavioral Shifts
- Think in constraints — the Technical Environment Document tells AI-DLC v1 what it CAN and CANNOT use
- Be specific — "PostgreSQL 16" not "a relational database"; "React 18 with TypeScript" not "a modern frontend"
- Include allow/disallow lists — AI-DLC v1 uses these to restrict tool selection during code generation
- Frontend patterns from UXD are equally authoritative as backend patterns from ADLC

### Anti-Patterns for This Activity
- Do NOT include product vision or user stories (that's `info/vision.md`)
- Do NOT be vague about technology choices — specificity is the point
- Do NOT omit the frontend section when UXD is present — it's a first-class part of the tech environment
- Do NOT duplicate full token definitions (those live in `design-system.md`) — reference the format and system name

| ... | ... | ... |
<!-- end: AP-sourced -->

## Frontend Patterns
<!-- begin: UXP-sourced (if UXD present) / AP-sourced (if UXD absent) -->

### IF UXD PRESENT:
| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| Component Library | {from UXP — design system name + architecture style} |
| Design Token Format | {from UXP — e.g., W3C Design Tokens / Style Dictionary JSON / CSS custom properties} |
| Token Delivery | {how tokens reach code — e.g., npm package / generated CSS / JSON import} |
| Component Architecture | {from UXP — e.g., Atomic Design: atoms → molecules → organisms} |
| State Management | {from AP Technology Stack} |
| Styling Approach | {from AP + UXP — e.g., CSS Modules with design tokens / Tailwind with token overrides} |
| Design System Reference | See `rules/design-system.md` for full token inventory and component rules |

### IF UXD ABSENT:
| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| UI Framework | {from AP Technology Stack} |
| State Management | {from AP Technology Stack} |
| Styling | {from AP Technology Stack} |
| Component Patterns | {from AP C4 L3 — if UI components described} |
<!-- end: UXP-sourced / AP-sourced -->

## Security Requirements

<!-- end: AP-sourced -->
```

## Transformation Rules

| Source | Output Section | Condition |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| AP Technology Stack — full selections | Tech Summary + Languages & Frameworks (Allowed) | IF ADLC |
| AP Technology Stack — rejected alternatives | Languages & Frameworks (Disallowed) | IF ADLC |
| AP Infrastructure — cloud services | Cloud Services (allow/disallow) | IF ADLC |
| AP Component Design — patterns + layering | Architecture Patterns | IF ADLC |
| AP Security Architecture | Security Requirements | IF ADLC |
| AP Quality Attributes — test requirements | Testing Requirements | IF ADLC |
| UXP Design System — component lib + tokens | Frontend Patterns (enriched) | IF UXD |
| UXP Accessibility Baseline — tools + level | Testing Requirements (a11y row) | IF UXD |
| ADRs | Referenced throughout (rationale links) | IF ADLC |

### Key Rules

1. **Specificity over generality.** "PostgreSQL 16.2" not "SQL database." "React 18.3 with TypeScript 5.4" not "modern frontend."
2. **Allow/Disallow lists are AI-DLC v1 constraints.** AI-DLC v1 uses these to restrict its code generation — be explicit about what's forbidden.
3. **Frontend Patterns are first-class.** When UXD is present, the Frontend Patterns section is as detailed as Security Requirements. It's not a footnote.
4. **Don't duplicate design-system.md.** Reference it ("See design-system.md for full token inventory") — don't copy all tokens into this file.
5. **ADR references provide rationale.** Every major decision links to an ADR so AI-DLC v1 can understand WHY (helpful for edge cases during code generation).

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| ADLC present, UXD absent | Frontend Patterns section uses AP Technology Stack only. Less detailed but still valid. |
| UXD provides frontend framework that differs from ADLC | Cross-input conflict — surface via conflict gate. Do NOT proceed. |
| No cloud services in AP | Cloud Services section: "No cloud services specified — local development only" |
| AP has no explicit disallow list | Disallowed sections: "No explicit restrictions documented — use judgment" (flag for improvement) |
| UXD token format not recognized | Include as-is: "Token Format: {whatever UXD specified}" — implementation handles format translation |
