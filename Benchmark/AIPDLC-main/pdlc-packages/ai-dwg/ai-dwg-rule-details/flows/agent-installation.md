# Post-Generation: Agent Installation

## Purpose

The orchestration logic for installing the AI-DWG governance agent into the destination workspace after any generation or reconciliation completes (Mode 1, 2, or 3). This step is **automatic** — no user interaction required. The core (`core-generator.md`) carries the pointer + the `WIA__` trigger name; this file carries the install steps. Templates live in `templates/agents/` (`workspace-integrity-agent.md`, `shortcut-rules-block.md`, `agent-guide.md`).

---

## What Gets Installed

| Artifact | Destination | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `workspace-integrity-agent.md` | `.kiro/agents/` | Copy from `templates/agents/` |
| Shortcut rules block | `rules/workspace-rules.md` | Append `<!-- BEGIN AI-DWG AGENT SHORTCUTS -->` block (or replace if exists) |
| Agent registry entries | `.governance/AGENT_REGISTRY.md` | Create file if absent; append AI-DWG entries if exists |
| Agent guide section | `.governance/AGENT-GUIDE.md` | Create file if absent; append AI-DWG section if exists |

## Installation Logic

1. **Agent file:** Copy `templates/agents/workspace-integrity-agent.md` to `.kiro/agents/workspace-integrity-agent.md`. Populate `{version}` with current AI-DWG version and `{ISO-date}` with today's date.

2. **Shortcut block:** Check `rules/workspace-rules.md` for `<!-- BEGIN AI-DWG AGENT SHORTCUTS -->` marker:
   - If found → replace the block (between BEGIN and END markers)
   - If not found → append the block from `templates/agents/shortcut-rules-block.md`

3. **Agent registry:** Check for `.governance/AGENT_REGISTRY.md`:
   - If absent → create with header + AI-DWG entry (DWG-AG-01)
   - If exists → append AI-DWG entry using next available `DWG-AG-{NN}` ID
   - Entry: `| DWG-AG-01 | workspace-integrity-agent | Audit | WIA__ | 1 | AI-DWG | Active | {date} |`

4. **Agent guide:** Check for `.governance/AGENT-GUIDE.md`:
   - If absent → create with header + AI-DWG section from `templates/agents/agent-guide.md`
   - If exists → append AI-DWG section (between `<!-- BEGIN AI-DWG AGENT GUIDE SECTION -->` markers)

## Self-Sufficiency Rule (AGENT_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT §5)

AI-DWG installs its own agent independently. No dependency on AI-GCE or any other package being present. If other packages run later, they will detect and preserve the AI-DWG entries via marker-based ownership.

## Post-Install Confirmation

```
🤖 AI-DWG Governance Agent Installed
   • Agent: workspace-integrity-agent (DWG-AG-01)
   • Shortcut: WIA__ (active immediately)
   • Call WIA__ after generation/reconciliation to validate workspace integrity.
```

## Family upgrade agent (create-if-absent) — PDLC-UPG-01 / `UPG__`

In addition to this package's quality agent, install the **family upgrade agent** — a family-level agent shared by all PDLC packages, installed once per workspace. Whichever PDLC package the user installs provides it; later packages detect it and skip.

1. **Install agent (if absent)** → if the platform agent slot has no `family-upgrade-agent.md`, copy `templates/agents/family-upgrade-agent.md` there. If it exists, skip.
2. **Register the `UPG__` shortcut (if absent)** → if `.kiro/steering/workspace-rules.md` has no `<!-- BEGIN PDLC UPGRADE SHORTCUT -->` marker, append `templates/agents/upgrade-shortcut-block.md`. If present, skip.
3. **Register in AGENT_REGISTRY.md (if absent)** → append the `PDLC-UPG-01` row — agent `family-upgrade-agent`, type **Migration**, trigger `UPG__`, producer PDLC (family-level), scope: all PDLC `pdlc-ws/` output. Do not duplicate if already present.
4. **Catalogue availability** → the upgrade agent reads `.aiflc/pdlc/MIGRATION_CATALOGUE.md` (installed as a family artifact). No per-package action needed beyond ensuring the family install placed it.

The upgrade agent is report-and-confirm and idempotent — see `family-upgrade-agent.md` and `MIGRATION_CATALOGUE.md`.
