# Why Architecture Before Code Matters

**Purpose:** Explains why designing system structure, boundaries, and integration patterns before implementation prevents structural failure — the kind of failure that can't be patched, only rebuilt.

---

## The Practice

Architecture-before-code means defining system context, container boundaries, component responsibilities, and integration contracts before writing implementation code. It establishes the structural skeleton that code fills in — not the other way around.

---

## What Happens When You Skip It

1. **The accidental monolith.** Without boundary decisions, code grows organically. Service A calls Service B's database directly. Module C imports from Module D's internals. By month 6, everything depends on everything — deployment requires coordinating all teams, and a change anywhere risks breakage everywhere.

2. **The "we'll refactor later" debt spiral.** Teams defer structural decisions ("we'll split this when it gets too big"). The split never happens because the coupling grows faster than the pain threshold. When it finally becomes unbearable, the refactoring cost exceeds the original build cost.

3. **Security architecture as afterthought.** Without explicit security boundary decisions, auth logic scatters across services. Data flows cross trust boundaries without validation. The penetration test reveals 40 findings because security was never designed — it was sprinkled.

4. **Scaling hits a wall.** The system works at 100 users. At 10,000 users, a single database becomes the bottleneck. The architecture assumed single-node patterns. Scaling now requires rewriting the data layer, which touches every service.

5. **Integration becomes archaeology.** Three teams build against undocumented contracts. At integration, Team A sends JSON, Team B expects XML, and Team C assumed GraphQL. The "integration sprint" becomes an integration quarter.

## Real-World Impact

| Dimension | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Cost | Architecture rework averages 40–60% of total project budget when discovered post-implementation. Upfront design costs 5–10% of budget and prevents 80% of structural issues. |
| Timeline | Projects that skip architecture average 3–6 month delays from "we need to rewrite the foundation" realizations mid-delivery. |
| Quality | Emergent architecture accumulates coupling debt at compound rates. Each feature added without boundary awareness increases the blast radius of the next bug. |
| Team | Teams without shared architecture make contradictory assumptions. The resulting conflicts surface as blame ("your service broke mine") rather than design discussions. |
| Risk | Non-functional requirements (performance, security, availability) are architectural decisions. Discovering they can't be met post-implementation means rebuild, not fix. |

## How the AI-* Family Prevents This

| Package | Feature | Prevention Mechanism |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **AI-ADLC** | 13-stage progressive decomposition | Forces architecture design through C4 levels (System Context → Containers → Components) with gates at each level. No implementation starts until L2 boundaries are stable. |
| **AI-ADLC** | ADR-driven decisions | Every major architecture choice (tech stack, isolation pattern, security model, data strategy) produces a formal Architecture Decision Record with options considered and consequences documented. |
| **AI-ADLC** | Extension system (6 patterns) | When architecture demands DDD, Microservices, BFF, Event Sourcing, Resilience patterns, or Feature Flags — dedicated rule sets activate with blocking constraints that prevent half-implementations. |
| **AI-DWG** | Workspace generated FROM architecture | The development workspace is generated directly from the Architecture Package — folder structure, steering files, and governance rules derive from architectural decisions. Code structure reflects design, not accident. |
| **AI-GCE** | Architectural compliance rules | Governance hooks enforce architecture boundaries at code time: module boundary violations, forbidden dependencies, missing API contracts — caught before commit, not in review. |

## The Decomposition Guarantee

AI-ADLC enforces a specific progression that prevents the most common architecture failures:

```
L1: System Context   → "What exists around us? What do we integrate with?"
    Gate: boundaries and external dependencies explicit

L2: Containers       → "What are the major deployable units?"
    Gate: each container has a single responsibility, clear API surface

L3: Components       → "Within each container, what are the internal building blocks?"
    Gate: component dependencies are acyclic, interfaces defined

Only after L3 is stable → AI-DWG generates implementation workspace
```

Each level's gate prevents proceeding until the structural decisions at that level are reviewed and approved. You cannot detail components (L3) before containers (L2) are stable — because component decisions depend on container boundaries.

---

## The Counter-Argument (and Why It Fails)

**"We use microservices / serverless — architecture emerges from small pieces."**

Small pieces still have boundaries, contracts, and integration patterns. Microservices without architecture become distributed monoliths — all the complexity of distribution plus all the coupling of a monolith. Serverless functions without architecture become an untraceable event spaghetti. The smaller the pieces, the MORE important the structural design that connects them.

The AI-* Family doesn't mandate heavy architecture docs. Depth levels (Minimal / Standard / Comprehensive) calibrate the detail to project complexity. A simple CRUD app gets lightweight containers and basic API contracts. A distributed system with 8 integrations gets full decomposition with resilience patterns. The architecture scales to the problem — but it always exists before code.

---

## Severity: Critical

Architecture is the one thing you cannot add later. You can add tests later (expensive but possible). You can add documentation later (annoying but doable). You cannot add architecture later — you can only rebuild with architecture. Every "rewrite from scratch" project is a confession that architecture was skipped.
