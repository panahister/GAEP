# Why Module Boundaries Matter

**Purpose:** Explains why defining and enforcing boundaries between code modules prevents coupling — the silent force that turns maintainable systems into unmaintainable ones.

---

## The Practice

Module boundaries mean that each code module (service, package, bounded context, layer) has a defined public interface, owns its internal state, and communicates with other modules only through that interface. Internal implementation is hidden; dependencies are explicit and directional.

---

## What Happens When You Skip It

1. **The "change one thing, break five things" cascade.** Module A imports Module B's internal helper. Module C imports the same helper. Someone refactors Module B's internals — A and C break. Without boundaries, every internal change is a potential breaking change for unknown consumers.

2. **The circular dependency trap.** Module A depends on B, B depends on C, C depends on A. Deployment requires all three to update simultaneously. Testing requires the entire system. A single module cannot be understood in isolation.

3. **The accidental distributed monolith.** Services split into microservices (separate repos, separate deploys) but still share internal data models. Changing a field in Service A requires redeploying Service B. The distribution added network complexity without gaining independence.

4. **The "nobody knows what this module does" fog.** Without explicit interfaces, a module's responsibility grows organically. It starts as "user management" and ends as "user management + notifications + audit logging + config." No one can describe its boundary in one sentence.

5. **The blocked team.** Two teams need to modify the same module simultaneously. Without clear boundaries and interfaces, their changes conflict. One team waits. Multiply across 8 teams and 20 modules without boundaries — gridlock.

## Real-World Impact

| Dimension | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Cost | Coupling-related bugs average 4x the fix time of boundary-respecting bugs because the blast radius spans multiple modules. |
| Timeline | Teams with undefined boundaries spend 30-40% of sprint time on unplanned coordination (merge conflicts, integration debugging, dependency untangling). |
| Quality | Systems without boundaries accumulate coupling at compound rates. Complexity grows exponentially with module count instead of linearly. |
| Team | Unclear ownership (who owns the boundary between A and B?) creates friction, blame, and blocked PRs. Clear boundaries = clear ownership. |
| Risk | Unbounded systems cannot be partially deployed, partially tested, or partially understood. Every change carries full-system risk. |

## How the AI-* Family Prevents This

| Package | Feature | Prevention Mechanism |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **AI-ADLC** | C4 decomposition (L2 → L3) | Forces explicit container and component boundaries with defined responsibilities and interfaces before any code is written. |
| **AI-ADLC** | DDD Tactical extension | When activated, adds bounded context rules — aggregate boundaries, anti-corruption layers, context mapping. |
| **AI-DWG** | `module-structure.md` steering | Generates steering file defining which modules exist, what each owns, and what dependencies are allowed. |
| **AI-DWG** | Folder structure from architecture | Generates physical folder boundaries that mirror logical architecture boundaries. Structure enforces separation. |
| **AI-GCE** | ARCH-01: Module boundary rules | Enforces import restrictions — hooks block cross-boundary imports that violate the defined dependency direction. |
| **AI-GCE** | Domain layer purity hooks | Prevents infrastructure code from leaking into domain layers and vice versa. |

## Severity: High

Module boundaries are what allow systems to scale — in code size, team size, and deployment complexity. Without them, every addition increases the cost of the next addition. Systems without boundaries don't fail suddenly — they gradually become impossible to change, until someone says "we need to rewrite it."
