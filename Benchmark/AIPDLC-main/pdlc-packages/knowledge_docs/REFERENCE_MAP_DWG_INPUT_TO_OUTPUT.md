# Reference Map: AI-DWG Input → Destination Workspace

**Purpose:** Complete lookup table of what AI-DWG reads from each design-time peer input (AI-ADLC, AI-POLC, AI-UXD) and exactly where the result lands in the generated development workspace. Use this to answer "if I run AI-DWG with these inputs, what files will I get and where?"

---

## How to Read This

AI-DWG is a **convergence-point generator**. It accepts any non-empty subset of three peer inputs and generates only the **output clusters** whose input is present:

| Peer Input | Producer | Marker File | Output Cluster |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **AP** — Architecture Package | AI-ADLC | `adlc-state.md` | Technical (steering, configs, source structure) |
| **PBP** — Product Backlog Package | AI-POLC | `polc-state.md` | Product (vision, backlog, traceability, value) |
| **UXP** — UX Design Package | AI-UXD | `uxd-state.md` | UX (design system, navigation, content, theming) |

**Key rules:**
- **One input → one output cluster.** Every generated file traces to exactly one peer input. If that input is absent, its cluster is skipped (with a quality-impact disclosure to you before generation).
- **Conditional within a cluster.** Even when an input is present, some outputs only appear if the input actually contains the relevant artefact (e.g. theming only if the design defined multiple brands or dark mode).
- **Paths shown are relative to the generated dev-workspace root.** Steering files land in `.kiro/steering/`; AI-DLC v1 input documents and operational docs land at the workspace root.

## Always Generated (Regardless of Inputs)

These are produced no matter which inputs are present (a minimal workspace is always coherent):

| Destination File | Type |
|------------------|------|
| `.kiro/steering/workspace-rules.md` | Core rules + identity + Project ID correlation key (minimal version with a single input) |
| Operational docs (`PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `ONBOARDING`, etc.) | Operational |
| `.github/` PR template | Config |

## Notes on Shared Outputs

Some outputs draw from more than one input — they are still anchored to one **primary** cluster:

| Output | Primary Input | Secondary Contributor |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| `vision.md` | POLC (vision, scope, metrics) | UXD (personas, journeys → Target Users) |
| `technical-environment.md` | ADLC (stack, security, quality) | UXD (frontend patterns, design tokens) |
| `frontend-standards.md` | UXD (component/pattern inventory) | ADLC (UI container architecture) |
| `value-metrics.md` | POLC (KPIs) | ADLC (instrumentation relay into observability) |
| `aidlc-rules/extensions/` | ADLC (security extension) | UXD (accessibility), AI-TGE/DWG (testing) |

When a contributing input is absent, the output is still generated from its primary input; the secondary section is omitted with a note.
