# Anatomy of a State File

**Purpose:** Field-by-field breakdown of AI-* Family state files — what each field means, when it's set, who reads it, and how to reconstruct one if lost.

**Derived from:** Pattern: Marker File Detection + Pattern: Gate Before Transition

## What a State File Is

A state file is a persistent markdown document that serves TWO roles simultaneously:
1. **Session continuity** — tells any AI session where to resume
2. **Chain marker** — tells successor packages that this output exists and what it contains

Every lifecycle package produces one. Its filename is non-negotiable.

## Universal Fields (All State Files)

```markdown
# {Package} State

## Project Identity

- Status: In Progress
- Workflow Depth: Standard
- Output Structure: numbered

## Completed Stages
| Stage | Name | Completed | Gate Approved By |
|:-----:|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Workspace Detection | 2026-06-10 09:15 | auto |
| 2 | Source Ingestion | 2026-06-10 09:45 | User |
| 3 | Requirement Structuring | 2026-06-10 10:30 | User |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Session History
- Last Session: 2026-06-11 14:00

## Field-by-Field Reference

### Project Identity

| Field | Set When | Changed When | Read By |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `Project ID` | Stage 1 (minted) | Never (immutable) | All successor packages (correlation key) |
| `Project Name` | Stage 1 | Rarely (rename only) | Successor packages (display/context) |

**Project ID format:** `PRJ-{ABBREVIATION}-{YEAR}-{SEQUENCE}`
- Minted by AI-PILC (or AI-ILC if it runs first)
- Carried forward through the entire chain
- Used by AI-PPM for portfolio roll-up

### Progress

| Field | Set When | Changed When | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `Current Phase` | Stage 1 | Every phase boundary | Resume: which phase are we in? |
| `Current Stage` | Stage 1 | Every stage completion (gate pass) | Resume: which stage is next? |
| `Status` | Creation | Workflow milestones | `In Progress` / `Complete` / `Paused` / `Abandoned` |
| `Workflow Depth` | Stage 2 (ingestion) | Rarely (depth override) | Controls stage behavior for all remaining stages |
| `Output Structure` | Stage 1 | Never (once set) | `numbered` / `flat` — tells successors the internal deliverable sub-structure pattern |

### Completed Stages

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Stage number | Which stage completed |
| Name | Human-readable stage name |
| Completed timestamp | When gate was passed (ISO date or datetime) |
| Gate Approved By | Who approved (`User` / `auto` for detection stages) |

**Audit value:** Proves each stage was reviewed and approved. Certification evidence.

### Session History

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Last Session | When the workflow was last active (enables "stale" detection) |
| Total Sessions | How many sessions this workflow has spanned |
| Session Platform | Which AI platform ran the last session |

    "tier1": "2026-05-15",
    "tier2": "2026-06-01",
    "tier3": null
  }
}
```

### AI-TGE (`tge-state.md`) adds:

```markdown

- Covered: 32
- Gaps: 13
- Risk Score (avg): 2.8/5
- Phase: Observation (Strategy complete)
```

## How Successor Packages Read State Files

| Successor | Fields It Reads | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| AI-ADLC reads `pilc-state.md` | Status, Depth, Output Structure, Project ID | Confirms PIP is complete, inherits depth, knows file naming |
| AI-DWG reads `adlc-state.md` | Enabled Extensions, Output Structure, Container Count | Triggers extension-enrichment, knows what to generate |
| AI-GCE reads workspace marker | (Doesn't read a state file — detects `.kiro/steering/`) | Presence = workspace exists |
| AI-TGE reads `adlc-state.md` | Extensions, ADR Count, Containers | Derives test requirements from architecture scope |

## How to Reconstruct a Lost State File

If state file is missing but artifacts exist:

```markdown
# {Package} State (Reconstructed)

## Project Identity
- Project ID: {from charter or first artifact header}
- Project Name: {from charter or PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md}

## Progress
- Current Phase: {infer from last artifact — which phase does it belong to?}
- Current Stage: {count produced artifacts → last stage with artifact + 1}
- Status: {Complete if all artifacts exist, In Progress otherwise}
- Workflow Depth: {Standard (default) — or infer from artifact detail level}
- Output Structure: {look at filenames — numbered (01_, 02_) vs flat}

## Completed Stages
{List stages whose artifacts exist with estimated dates from file timestamps}
```

**This is sufficient for:**
- Resuming the workflow (position is correct)
- Successor detection (marker exists, status readable)

**What's lost:**
- Exact gate timestamps
- Decision log (if not in artifacts)
- Session history

## State File Location Rules

| Package Type | State File Location | Why There |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------| 
| Lifecycle (PILC, ADLC, POLC, UXD, ILC) | Root of output folder | Alongside the artifacts it tracks |
| Generator (DWG) | No state file — uses workspace marker | Generator output IS the workspace; marker is `workspace-rules.md` |
| Engine (GCE) | Workspace root (`.compliance-state.json`) | Governance applies to the whole workspace |
| Hybrid (TGE) | Root of test governance output | Alongside strategy + register |
