# What If the Team Rejects Governance?

**Scenario:** You activated AI-GCE governance but the team pushes back — disabling hooks, ignoring violations, complaining about friction, or requesting to remove governance entirely.

---

## Symptoms

- Hooks are being disabled or bypassed manually
- Compliance score drops steadily (not a dip — a trend)
- Team members express frustration in standups or retros
- PRs include comments like "governance blocked this, I worked around it"
- "Can we just turn this off?" requests

---

## Diagnosis: WHY Is the Team Rejecting?

Before reacting, identify the root cause:

| Root Cause | Signals | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Too much, too fast** | Happened right after activation; team was fine before | Roll back to lower tier, reintroduce gradually |
| **Rules don't match reality** | Specific rules have high false-positive rates | Tune or disable those specific rules |
| **No explanation** | Team doesn't understand WHY rules exist | Share `.governance/COMPLIANCE_README.md`, explain value |
| **Wrong tier for maturity** | Team hasn't mastered basics, advanced rules activated | Drop to appropriate tier |
| **Cultural mismatch** | "We've never had rules and we're fine" attitude | Demonstrate value with metrics (incidents prevented) |
| **One vocal objector** | Most team is fine, one person is loudly resistant | Address individually, not systemically |
| **Legitimate blocker** | A rule genuinely prevents valid work patterns | Fix the rule — the team is right |

## Recovery Playbook

### Step 1: Don't Panic — Don't Remove Everything

The worst response is removing all governance. That teaches the team: "complain enough and rules disappear." Instead:

### Step 2: Acknowledge and Diagnose (Day 1)

- Acknowledge the friction in standup/retro
- Ask: "Which specific rules are causing pain?"
- Don't defend governance abstractly — listen to specifics

### Step 3: Categorize Complaints (Day 2-3)

| Complaint | Category | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| "This rule caught something that's actually fine" | False positive | Tune the rule or add exception |
| "I don't understand why this rule exists" | Communication gap | Explain the WHY (share the relevant WHY doc) |
| "This blocks my workflow" | Legitimate friction | Investigate — is the rule too strict, or is the workflow non-standard? |
| "We've never needed this" | Cultural resistance | Show what it prevents (concrete examples, not theory) |
| "There are too many rules" | Overwhelm | Reduce to fewer rules, add others later |

### Step 4: Take Concrete Action (Week 1)

**If too-much-too-fast:**
- Roll back to Tier 1 (or one tier lower than current)
- Announce: "We're scaling back. We'll add rules gradually as we're ready."
- Set a date to revisit (4 weeks out)

**If rules don't match reality:**
- Disable the specific offending rules (with documented rationale)
- Investigate: is the steering wrong? is the rule derived incorrectly?
- Fix steering → re-derive → better rules

**If no explanation was given:**
- Schedule 15-min session: "Here's what governance does and why"
- Share relevant WHY docs (e.g., `WHY_SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES_MATTERS.md`)
- Show compliance log: "Here's what it caught last week that would have been a bug"

**If legitimate blocker:**
- The team is right — fix the rule
- Log: "Rule X disabled because it blocks legitimate pattern Y"
- Add to steering: exception for this pattern

### Step 5: Rebuild Trust (Weeks 2-4)

- Keep governance lightweight (Tier 1 only if needed)
- Celebrate when governance catches a real issue ("naming hook prevented a merge conflict today")
- Let the team participate: "Which rule should we add next?"
- Show trend: compliance score improving = team getting better, not governance getting heavier

## What NOT to Do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Force it ("governance is mandatory, deal with it") | Creates resentment; team bypasses silently |
| Remove everything ("fine, no governance then") | Teaches team that resistance works; loses all protection |
| Blame the team ("you're not mature enough") | Damages trust; the problem is the governance fit, not the team |
| Add MORE rules to prevent bypassing | Escalation spiral; makes rejection worse |
| Ignore the feedback | Dissatisfaction festers into active sabotage |

---

## Prevention (for Next Time)

| Measure | How |
|---------|-----|
| Start at Tier 1 ALWAYS | Even if you think the team can handle more |
| Include team in rule selection | "Which of these rules would be valuable to you?" |
| Grace period on new rules | Advisory-only for 1 week before blocking |
| Explain before activating | Never surprise the team with new enforcement |
| Make governance visible | Team knows what's active, why, and how to get exceptions |
| Celebrate catches, don't punish violations | Governance is a safety net, not a punishment tool |

---

## Metrics That Indicate Recovery

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Compliance score stabilizing | Team is adapting to the current level |
| Fewer hook-disable requests | Friction is decreasing |
| Team suggests adding a rule | Cultural buy-in achieved |
| Violations are discussed constructively in retros | Governance is part of improvement, not blame |
| New member says "the hooks are helpful" | Governance is perceived as onboarding tool |
