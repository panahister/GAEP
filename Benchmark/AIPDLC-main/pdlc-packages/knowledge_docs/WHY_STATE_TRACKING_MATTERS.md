# Why State Tracking Matters

**Purpose:** Explains why maintaining persistent workflow state (where you are, what's been decided, what's next) prevents the most common AI-assisted workflow failure — losing context between sessions and repeating or contradicting prior work.

---

## The Practice

State tracking means maintaining a persistent record of workflow progress, decisions made, and configuration choices in a dedicated state file that any session (any AI model, any day, any developer) can load and resume from exactly where the last session left off.

---

## What Happens When You Skip It

1. **The "where were we?" tax.** Every new AI session starts with 10 minutes of re-explaining context. "We already decided on PostgreSQL. We already covered stages 1-5. We already chose the microservices pattern." Without state, every session is a cold start.

2. **The contradicting decisions.** Session 1 decides "JWT-based auth." Session 3 (different day, different context window) recommends "session-based auth" because it doesn't know about Session 1's decision. Without state, decisions don't persist across sessions.

3. **The repeated work problem.** Session 1 produces a stakeholder register. Session 2 (after a crash or context reset) produces a DIFFERENT stakeholder register because it didn't know the first existed. Work is duplicated, and the two versions conflict.

4. **The "phantom progress" illusion.** The user thinks stages 1-7 are complete. The AI has no record and begins at stage 1. The user skips ahead manually, missing gates and validations. The output has gaps no one notices until downstream packages fail.

5. **The multi-person disconnect.** Developer A runs stages 1-5 on Monday. Developer B picks up on Tuesday but has no way to know what A decided, what depth was chosen, or what constraints were captured. B re-asks questions A already answered, creating contradictory parallel artifacts.

## Real-World Impact

| Dimension | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Cost | Context re-establishment costs 10-20 minutes per session. Across 50 sessions in a project lifecycle, that's 8-16 hours of pure waste — repeating what was already known. |
| Timeline | Contradicting decisions (discovered downstream) cause 1-3 day rework cycles per occurrence. State tracking prevents them entirely. |
| Quality | Multi-session workflows without state produce internally inconsistent output. The architecture decisions in Stage 6 may contradict constraints captured in Stage 3 — because Stage 6 didn't know about Stage 3. |
| Team | When multiple team members use the same workflow, state is the coordination mechanism. Without it, each person's session is an island with no shared truth. |
| Risk | A workflow that can't resume reliably means any session crash loses all progress since the last completed gate. State files make crashes recoverable. |

## How the AI-* Family Prevents This

| Package | Feature | Prevention Mechanism |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **AI-PILC** | `pilc-state.md` | Tracks: current phase/stage, completed stages with timestamps, decisions made, depth level, output structure. Any session can resume exactly where the last one stopped. |
| **AI-ADLC** | `adlc-state.md` | Tracks: phases, stages, enabled extensions, ADR register, input mode, architecture workbook state. |
| **AI-POLC** | `polc-state.md` | Tracks: backlog elaboration progress, prioritization state, acceptance criteria coverage. |
| **AI-GCE** | `.compliance-state.json` | Tracks: current tier, compliance score, audit history, baseline data, tier readiness signals. |
| **All packages** | State-before-transition rule | State file is updated BEFORE presenting the next stage. If session crashes between stages, state reflects last completed gate — enabling clean resume. |
| **All packages** | Cold resume guarantee | State file contains EVERYTHING needed to resume. Zero prior context required. New session + new model = perfect continuation. |

## Severity: High

State tracking is what makes multi-session workflows possible. Without it, every workflow longer than one session is fragile, every decision is ephemeral, and every team handoff requires manual context transfer. AI sessions are inherently stateless — state files give them memory.
